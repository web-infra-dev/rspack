# Glossary

Terms and concepts used in Rspack codebase and documentation.

## Core Concepts

### Bundler

Tool that combines multiple JavaScript modules and dependencies into optimized bundles.

### Module

Single unit of code (typically JS/TS file) that can be imported/required by other modules.

### Chunk

Group of modules bundled together into a single output file. Types: entry chunks, async chunks, vendor chunks.

### Entry Point

Starting point(s) of the application. Rspack builds the module graph from entry points.

### Module Graph

Dependency graph structure tracking all modules and their dependencies in compilation.

### Chunk Graph

Graph structure tracking relationships between chunks and which modules belong to which chunks.

## Compilation Terms

### Compilation

Single build instance that processes modules, creates chunks, and generates output assets.

### Compiler

Main orchestrator managing compilation lifecycle, plugins, and configuration.

### Build

Process of transforming source code into optimized output files.

### Make Phase

Phase where modules are built and dependency graph is constructed.

### Seal Phase

Phase where compilation is finalized and no more modules can be added.

### Emit Phase

Phase where output assets are written to the file system.

## Module System

### Normal Module

Regular JavaScript/TypeScript module parsed and processed normally.

### Context Module

Module created from dynamic require context (e.g., `require.context('./dir', true, /\.js$/)`).

### External Module

Module not bundled but referenced externally (e.g., from CDN or global variable).

### Concatenated Module

Multiple modules concatenated together for optimization (scope hoisting).

### Runtime Module

Module containing webpack runtime code for module loading and HMR.

## Dependency Types

### Dependency

Relationship between modules, representing an import, require, or other module reference.

### Module Dependency

Dependency on another module (e.g., `import './module'`).

### Entry Dependency

Dependency representing an entry point.

### Context Dependency

Dependency representing a require context.

### External Dependency

Dependency on external module that won't be bundled.

## Chunk Types

### Entry Chunk

Chunk generated from entry point. Can be initial (loaded immediately) or non-initial.

### Async Chunk

Chunk loaded asynchronously (e.g., via dynamic import or code splitting).

### Initial Chunk

Chunk that must be loaded before entry point can execute.

### Runtime Chunk

Chunk containing webpack runtime code, can be separated for better caching.

### Vendor Chunk

Chunk containing third-party dependencies, often separated for caching.

## Asset Terms

### Asset

Output file generated by compilation (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.).

### Source

Content of an asset, represented as Source object that can be read and transformed.

### Asset Info

Metadata about an asset (size, related assets, etc.).

### Filename Template

Template string for generating output filenames with placeholders (e.g., `[name].[hash].js`).

## Plugin System

### Plugin

JavaScript object or class extending Rspack's functionality by hooking into compilation lifecycle.

### Hook

Point in compilation process where plugins can intercept and modify behavior.

### Tap

Act of registering a callback function to a hook.

### Hook Type

Execution model of a hook (sync/async, series/parallel, bail).

### Builtin Plugin

Core plugin provided by Rspack (e.g., JavaScript plugin, CSS plugin).

## Loader System Terms

### Loader

Function that transforms source code before it's added to the dependency graph.

### Loader Chain

Sequence of loaders applied to a module in reverse order.

### Loader Context

Context object (`this`) provided to loaders with utilities and metadata.

### Pitch Loader

Loader that executes in the "pitch" phase (before loader chain runs normally).

## Optimization Terms

### Tree Shaking

Process of removing unused code from bundle by analyzing import/export usage.

### Code Splitting

Process of splitting code into multiple chunks for better caching and loading performance.

### Minification

Process of reducing code size by removing whitespace, shortening names, and optimizing code.

### Scope Hoisting

Optimization that concatenates modules into single scope to reduce function call overhead.

### Dead Code Elimination

Removing code that is never executed (form of tree shaking).

## Caching Terms

### Persistent Cache

Disk-based cache that persists across builds to speed up subsequent builds.

### Memory Cache

In-memory cache used during a single build.

### Cache Invalidation

Process of determining when cached data is no longer valid and needs regeneration.

### Cache Key

Unique identifier for cached data, typically based on file content and configuration.

## File System Terms

### Input File System

File system abstraction for reading source files.

### Output File System

File system abstraction for writing output files.

### Intermediate File System

File system abstraction for temporary files during compilation.

### Watch File System

File system abstraction for monitoring file changes in watch mode.

## Development Terms

### Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

Feature allowing updating modules in browser without full page reload.

### Watch Mode

Mode where Rspack watches for file changes and automatically rebuilds.

### Dev Server

Development server that serves built application and supports HMR.

### Source Map

File mapping transformed code back to original source code for debugging.

## Build Modes

### Development Mode

Optimized for fast builds and debugging, includes source maps and development tools.

### Production Mode

Optimized for smaller bundle size and performance, includes minification and tree shaking.

## Technical Terms

### AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)

Tree representation of syntactic structure of source code.

### NAPI (Node-API)

Stable API for building native Node.js addons, used for Rust-JavaScript interop.

### Binding

Layer connecting Rust code to JavaScript/TypeScript, typically via NAPI.

### Crate

Rust package/library (equivalent to npm package in JavaScript).

### Monorepo

Repository containing multiple related packages or projects.

## Rspack-Specific Terms

### Rspack

High-performance JavaScript bundler written in Rust.

### Rstack

Unified JavaScript toolchain centered on Rspack (includes Rspack, Rsbuild, Rslib, etc.).

### Builtin Loader

Loader implemented natively in Rust for better performance (e.g., SWC loader, Lightning CSS loader).

### Rspack Builtin Plugin

Core plugin provided by Rspack, typically implemented in Rust.

### RsDoctor

Build analyzer tool for debugging and optimizing Rspack builds.

### Rstest

Testing framework for Rspack.

### Rslint

Linter for Rspack projects.

## Webpack Compatibility Terms

### Webpack Compatible

API or feature that works the same way as in webpack.

### Webpack Plugin

Plugin designed for webpack that may or may not work with Rspack.

### Webpack Loader

Loader designed for webpack that may or may not work with Rspack.
