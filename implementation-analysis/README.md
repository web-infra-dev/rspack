# SWC-Macro Implementation Analysis

This analysis examines the current implementation for performance bottlenecks.

## Key Findings

### 1. Runtime Template Bottlenecks
- `runtime_template.rs` contains BFS traversal for shared module detection
- Called on every import statement generation
- No caching of traversal results

### 2. Performance TODOs
- Check `performance-todos.txt` for known optimization opportunities
- Module concatenation plugin has explicit O(n²) → O(n) TODO

### 3. Expensive Operations
- Review `expensive-ops.txt` for allocation patterns
- Look for high clone counts and mutex contention

### 4. Recent Changes
- `recent-changes.txt` shows commits that may have introduced regressions
- Focus on changes to runtime template and module processing

## Optimization Priorities

1. **Cache shared module detection results**
2. **Implement O(n) module concatenation algorithm**  
3. **Reduce string allocations in hot paths**
4. **Optimize mutex usage in memory GC**

## Next Steps

1. Profile with flamegraph to confirm bottlenecks
2. Implement caching for shared module detection
3. Optimize allocation patterns in hot paths
4. Consider parallelization for independent operations
