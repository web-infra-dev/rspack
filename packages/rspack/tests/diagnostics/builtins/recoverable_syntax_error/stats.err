ERROR in Ã— Resolve error: Can't resolve './' in '<PROJECT_ROOT>/tests/diagnostics/builtins/recoverable_syntax_error'
  help: Found the module './index.tsx' exists, but its extension is not listed in the `resolve.extensions`. Here are some possible solutions:
        
        1. add the extension `".tsx"` to `resolve.extensions` in your rspack configuration
        2. use './index.tsx' instead of './'
