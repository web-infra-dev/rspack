ERROR in × Entrypoint 'b1' has a 'runtime' option which points to another entrypoint named 'a1'.
  │ It's not valid to use other entrypoints as runtime chunk.
  │ Or do you want to use the entrypoints 'b1' and 'a1' independently on the same page with a shared runtime? In this case give them both the same value for the 'runtime' option. It must be a name
  │ not already used by an entrypoint.
