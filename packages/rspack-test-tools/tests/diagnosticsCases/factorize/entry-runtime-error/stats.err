ERROR in × Entrypoint 'b1' has a 'runtime' option which points to another entrypoint named 'a1'.
  │ It's not valid to use other entrypoints as runtime chunk.
  │ Did you mean to use 'dependOn: "a1"' instead to allow using entrypoint 'b1' within the runtime of entrypoint 'a1'? For this 'a1' must always be loaded when 'b1' is used.
  │ Or do you want to use the entrypoints 'b1' and 'a1' independently on the same page with a shared runtime? In this case give them both the same value for the 'runtime' option. It must be a name
  │ not already used by an entrypoint.
