  help: Found module './locale.js'. However, it's not possible to request this module without the extension
        if its extension was not listed in the `resolve.extensions`. Here're some possible solutions:
        
        1. add the extension `".js"` to `resolve.extensions` in your rspack configuration
        2. use './locale.js' instead of './locale'
