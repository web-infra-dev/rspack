  help: Did you mean './foo.js'?
        
        The request './foo' failed to resolve only because it was resolved as fully specified,
        probably because the origin is strict EcmaScript Module,
        e. g. a module with javascript mimetype, a '*.mjs' file, or a '*.js' file where the package.json contains '"type": "module"'.
        
        The extension in the request is mandatory for it to be fully specified.
        Add the extension to the request.
