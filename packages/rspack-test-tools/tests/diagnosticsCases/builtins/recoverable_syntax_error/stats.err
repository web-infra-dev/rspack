ERROR in × Resolve error: Can't resolve './' in '<PROJECT_ROOT>/tests/diagnosticsCases/builtins/recoverable_syntax_error'
  help: Found module './index.tsx'. However, it's not possible to request this module without the extension
        if its extension was not listed in the `resolve.extensions`. Here're some possible solutions:
        
        1. add the extension `".tsx"` to `resolve.extensions` in your rspack configuration
        2. use './index.tsx' instead of './'
