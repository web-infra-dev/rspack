See https://swc.rs/docs/plugin/selecting-swc-core for compatibility information. If you are an author of the plugin, please update `swc_core` to the compatible version.

        │                         Note that if you want to use the os features like filesystem, you need to use `wasi`. Wasm itself does not have concept of filesystem.

        │ Help:
        │     1. The version of the SWC WASM plugin you're using might not be compatible with `builtin:swc-loader`.
        │     2. The `swc_core` version of the current `rspack_core` is 0.99.5. Please check the `swc_core` version of SWC WASM plugin to make sure these versions are within the compatible range.
        │     3. Versions of `swc_core` are more likely to be located in the `Cargo.toml` file in the root directory of these plugin repositories.
        │     4. Check out this guide as a reference for selecting the versions of SWC WASM plugins: https://swc.rs/docs/plugin/selecting-swc-core
