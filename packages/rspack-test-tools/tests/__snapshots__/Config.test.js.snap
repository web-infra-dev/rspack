exports[`config config/builtins/enable-chunk-loading step  should pass 1`] = `Chunk loading type "non-existing" is not enabled. EnableChunkLoadingPlugin need to be used to enable this type of chunk loading. This usually happens through the "output.enabledChunkLoadingTypes" option. If you are using a function as entry which sets "chunkLoading", you need to add all potential chunk loading types to "output.enabledChunkLoadingTypes".
