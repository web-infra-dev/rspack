  help: Did you mean './foo.js'?
        
        Requests that should resolve in the current directory need to start with './'.
        Requests that start with a name are treated as module requests and resolve within module directories (node_modules).
        
        If changing the source code is not an option, there is also a resolve options called 'preferRelative'
        which tries to resolve these kind of requests in the current directory too.
