# Glossary

This document defines terms and concepts used throughout the Rspack codebase and documentation.

## Core Concepts

### Bundler

A tool that combines multiple JavaScript modules and their dependencies into optimized bundles for deployment.

### Module

A single unit of code, typically a JavaScript/TypeScript file, that can be imported or required by other modules.

### Chunk

A group of modules that are bundled together into a single output file. Chunks can be entry chunks, async chunks, or vendor chunks.

### Entry Point

The starting point(s) of the application. Rspack begins building the module graph from entry points.

### Module Graph

The dependency graph structure that tracks all modules and their dependencies in the compilation.

### Chunk Graph

The graph structure that tracks relationships between chunks and which modules belong to which chunks.

## Compilation Terms

### Compilation

A single build instance that processes modules, creates chunks, and generates output assets.

### Compiler

The main orchestrator that manages the compilation lifecycle, plugins, and configuration.

### Build

The process of transforming source code into optimized output files.

### Make Phase

The phase of compilation where modules are built and the dependency graph is constructed.

### Seal Phase

The phase where the compilation is finalized and no more modules can be added.

### Emit Phase

The phase where output assets are written to the file system.

## Module System

### Normal Module

A regular JavaScript/TypeScript module that is parsed and processed normally.

### Context Module

A module created from a dynamic require context (e.g., `require.context('./dir', true, /\.js$/)`).

### External Module

A module that is not bundled but referenced externally (e.g., from CDN or global variable).

### Concatenated Module

Multiple modules concatenated together for optimization (scope hoisting).

### Runtime Module

A module containing webpack runtime code for module loading and HMR.

## Dependency Types

### Dependency

A relationship between modules, representing an import, require, or other module reference.

### Module Dependency

A dependency on another module (e.g., `import './module'`).

### Entry Dependency

A dependency representing an entry point.

### Context Dependency

A dependency representing a require context.

### External Dependency

A dependency on an external module that won't be bundled.

## Chunk Types

### Entry Chunk

A chunk generated from an entry point. Can be initial (loaded immediately) or non-initial.

### Async Chunk

A chunk loaded asynchronously (e.g., via dynamic import or code splitting).

### Initial Chunk

A chunk that must be loaded before the entry point can execute.

### Runtime Chunk

A chunk containing webpack runtime code, can be separated for better caching.

### Vendor Chunk

A chunk containing third-party dependencies, often separated for caching.

## Asset Terms

### Asset

An output file generated by the compilation (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.).

### Source

The content of an asset, represented as a Source object that can be read and transformed.

### Asset Info

Metadata about an asset (size, related assets, etc.).

### Filename Template

A template string for generating output filenames with placeholders (e.g., `[name].[hash].js`).

## Plugin System

### Plugin

A JavaScript object or class that extends Rspack's functionality by hooking into the compilation lifecycle.

### Hook

A point in the compilation process where plugins can intercept and modify behavior.

### Tap

The act of registering a callback function to a hook.

### Hook Type

The execution model of a hook (sync/async, series/parallel, bail).

### Builtin Plugin

A core plugin provided by Rspack (e.g., JavaScript plugin, CSS plugin).

## Loader System Terms

### Loader

A function that transforms source code before it's added to the dependency graph.

### Loader Chain

A sequence of loaders applied to a module in reverse order.

### Loader Context

The context object (`this`) provided to loaders with utilities and metadata.

### Pitch Loader

A loader that executes in the "pitch" phase (before the loader chain runs normally).

## Optimization Terms

### Tree Shaking

The process of removing unused code from the bundle by analyzing import/export usage.

### Code Splitting

The process of splitting code into multiple chunks for better caching and loading performance.

### Minification

The process of reducing code size by removing whitespace, shortening names, and optimizing code.

### Scope Hoisting

An optimization that concatenates modules into a single scope to reduce function call overhead.

### Dead Code Elimination

Removing code that is never executed (a form of tree shaking).

## Caching Terms

### Persistent Cache

A disk-based cache that persists across builds to speed up subsequent builds.

### Memory Cache

An in-memory cache used during a single build.

### Cache Invalidation

The process of determining when cached data is no longer valid and needs to be regenerated.

### Cache Key

A unique identifier for cached data, typically based on file content and configuration.

## File System Terms

### Input File System

The file system abstraction for reading source files.

### Output File System

The file system abstraction for writing output files.

### Intermediate File System

The file system abstraction for temporary files during compilation.

### Watch File System

The file system abstraction for monitoring file changes in watch mode.

## Development Terms

### Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

A feature that allows updating modules in the browser without a full page reload.

### Watch Mode

A mode where Rspack watches for file changes and automatically rebuilds.

### Dev Server

A development server that serves the built application and supports HMR.

### Source Map

A file that maps the transformed code back to the original source code for debugging.

## Build Modes

### Development Mode

Optimized for fast builds and debugging, includes source maps and development tools.

### Production Mode

Optimized for smaller bundle size and performance, includes minification and tree shaking.

## Technical Terms

### AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)

A tree representation of the syntactic structure of source code.

### NAPI (Node-API)

A stable API for building native Node.js addons, used for Rust-JavaScript interop.

### Binding

The layer that connects Rust code to JavaScript/TypeScript, typically via NAPI.

### Crate

A Rust package/library (equivalent to npm package in JavaScript).

### Monorepo

A repository containing multiple related packages or projects.

## Rspack-Specific Terms

### Rspack

The high-performance JavaScript bundler written in Rust.

### Rstack

The unified JavaScript toolchain centered on Rspack (includes Rspack, Rsbuild, Rslib, etc.).

### Builtin Loader

A loader implemented natively in Rust for better performance (e.g., SWC loader, Lightning CSS loader).

### Rspack Builtin Plugin

A core plugin provided by Rspack, typically implemented in Rust.

### RsDoctor

A build analyzer tool for debugging and optimizing Rspack builds.

### Rstest

A testing framework for Rspack.

### Rslint

A linter for Rspack projects.

## Webpack Compatibility Terms

### Webpack Compatible

An API or feature that works the same way as in webpack.

### Webpack Plugin

A plugin designed for webpack that may or may not work with Rspack.

### Webpack Loader

A loader designed for webpack that may or may not work with Rspack.
