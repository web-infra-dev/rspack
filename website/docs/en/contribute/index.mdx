# Overview

We are grateful for your interest in contributing to Rspack!
Every single contribution counts and helps us take Rspack to the next level.

## Asking Questions

If you have any questions,
please do not hesitate to ask in either the [Discord](https://discord.gg/79ZZ66GH9E) support channel or on the [GitHub discussion board](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack/discussions).

### Minimal reproduction

The [Rspack repro template](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack-repro) can be used to create a minimal reproducible example.

A minimal reproducible example (MRE) is a code that is:

- Short
- Self-contained
- Demonstrates the problem being encountered

An MRE is essential because it allows us to quickly understand and reproduce your issue.
This, in turn, increases the likelihood of getting a helpful and accurate response in a shorter amount of time.
It is important to note that an MRE should not include extraneous code related to unrelated functionality,
and should instead focus solely on the problem at hand.

> Please see also [How to create a Minimal, Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) from Stack Overflow.
