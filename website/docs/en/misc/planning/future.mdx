# Future behavior & deprecation

## Breaking Changes

During the 0.y.z phase, Rspack may include breaking changes only when upgrading the minor (y) version, and ensures backward compatibility when upgrading the patch (z) version.

After reaching version 1.0.0, we will adhere to [semver](https://semver.org/) for version management.

## Future Default Behavior (Rspack Future)

Rspack provides some experimental features in [experiments.rspackFuture](/config/experiments#experimentsrspackfuture). These features will become the default behavior in the future, but they are currently not default and need to be explicitly enabled in the configuration file.
