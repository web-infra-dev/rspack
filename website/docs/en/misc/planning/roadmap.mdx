# Roadmap

This document provides an overview of the latest plans and progress for Rspack and the Rstack toolchain. It will be continuously updated as new versions are released.

> Last updated: 2025-10

## Rspack 2.0

We are developing Rspack 2.0 and Rsbuild 2.0, focusing on API and internal architecture improvements, performance optimization, adoption of modern web standards, and a better developer experience.

Key areas include:

- **Streamlined outputs and APIs**: Redesigning output structure and webpack-specific APIs for better clarity and simplicity, while maintaining compatibility.
- **Improved ESM output**: Enhancing ESM support and providing an out-of-the-box experience through Rsbuild and Rslib.
- **Built-in RSC support**: Inspired by tools like Parcel, offering built-in support for React Server Components.
- **More stable persistent cache**: Improving usability and reliability of persistent cache, with plans to enable it by default in development mode.
- **Enable Native watcher**: Using native watcher to reduce rebuild latency and improve HMR performance.
- **Core architecture optimization**: Refining the internal data flow to reduce memory usage and improve performance and maintainability.
- **Migration to pure ESM packages**: Converting all npm packages to pure ESM format and dropping Node.js 18 support.
- And more...

The first preview release is planned for **February 2026**. We will carefully review every breaking change to ensure a smooth upgrade path.

## Rstack toolchain

We are building a unified JavaScript toolchain centered around Rspack â€” [Rstack](/guide/start/ecosystem#rstack).

The main focus areas across Rstack tools include:

- Rsbuild: Developing 2.0 alongside Rspack, focusing on performance and developer experience.
- Rslib: Integrating Rspack's new ESM output, aiming for a 1.0 release once the APIs stabilize.
- Rsdoctor: Expanding AI Agent support via MCP and adding new features such as tree-shaking analysis.
- Rspress: Developing v2.0 with major architecture, UI, and feature improvements.
- Rstest: Enhancing testing capabilities with browser mode and VS Code extension. See the [Rstest Roadmap](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rstest/issues/85) for details.

## Remote cache

Rspack's caching system is evolving from memory cache to persistent cache, and we are actively exploring remote cache (portable cache).

This effort aims to make build caches shareable across different machines and environments, helping teams reduce redundant builds and improve efficiency.

## Enhanced ESM support

We are improving Rspack's ESM output and providing a seamless library-building experience through Rslib. This enables developers to build npm packages with better static analysis and tree-shaking support.

In parallel, we're extending Rspack's ESM capabilities for web applications, enabling applications to run natively as ESM in modern browsers.

## Performance improvements

We are continuously optimizing internal implementations â€” exploring more efficient concurrency models, better caching strategies, lower-overhead plugin communication, and various micro-optimizations.

## Community collaboration

Rspack has helped us solve many performance and efficiency challenges in real-world projects. We hope it can bring similar value to the broader community. We welcome collaborations with framework and tooling teams interested in Rspack integration â€” feel free to reach out for support.

## Webpack compatibility

Webpack provides a rich and diverse API. Rspack takes a progressive approach to compatibility, prioritizing high-usage loaders and plugins based on community feedback to ensure a smooth migration experience.

## Extending Rspack with Rust

Currently, higher-level tools and frameworks can integrate Rspack through its [JavaScript API](/api/javascript-api/index), which offers good extensibility. However, Rust-to-JavaScript communication introduces some overhead and limits performance.

We are developing a Rust extension system for Rspack to eliminate cross-language overhead. For more details, see the [Rspack 1.5 blog](/blog/announcing-1-5#extending-rspack-with-rust).
