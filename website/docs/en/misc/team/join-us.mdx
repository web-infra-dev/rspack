## üèÑ Who We Are

We are the Web Infra - Web Solutions team at ByteDance, serving the entire company's Web ecosystem. Our vision is to **create a world-class Web technology system, providing ByteDance products with the ultimate user and developer experience**.

We firmly believe that Web technology is one of the greatest things. The Web Infra team is dedicated to providing better tools, making Web development easier, enabling developers to enjoy a better development experience, and users to enjoy a better user experience. At the same time, open source has always been something we explore in the long term.

We have created a series of Web tools to enhance development efficiency and experience, including but not limited to:

- **Rust-based Web build tool** ‚Äî [Rspack](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack), aimed at building a high-performance front-end toolchain, providing cross-platform and Web scenarios with a "one step ahead" development experience, featuring extremely fast compilation and hot update performance.
- **Open source solutions based on Rspack**, including [Rsbuild](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rsbuild), [Rspress](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspress), and [Modern.js](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/modern.js), forming a series of ready-to-use solutions, offering multi-scenario support from Web building, static site generation to full-stack research and development.
- **High-performance Web solutions**, which go beyond the traditional Web. Breaking through the conventional WebView and combining with the end, browser kernel, we continue to explore various end performance optimization methods, allowing developers to enjoy optimization capabilities at an extremely low cost.
- **Modern Web engineering system**, including a React-based progressive Web development framework, esbuild-based module development tools, monorepo solutions, micro-frontend/micro-module solutions, and build diagnostic analysis tools.

Currently, these tools are widely used and well-received within ByteDance. At the same time, several projects have been open-sourced to GitHub, where they are being built and developed together with the community developers.

## ‚õ∫Ô∏è Where We Are

Currently, we have established R&D centers in five locations: US - Seattle, China - Beijing / Shanghai / Hangzhou / Shenzhen:
