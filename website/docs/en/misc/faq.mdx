# FAQ

## What will be the relationship between Rspack and webpack in the future?

**We have established a partnership with the webpack team.** Rspack is an attempt to optimize webpack performance using Rust, and it has already made good progress.

We will continue to explore more possibilities for optimizing webpack with the webpack team.

## Will compatibility with JavaScript or webpack ecosystem cause performance loss?

We place more emphasis on bringing performance improvements to existing web projects at a lower migration cost than simply chasing benchmark metrics.

Compatibility with the webpack ecosystem will result in some performance loss, but according to our verification results, this loss is within an acceptable range.

## How to achieve compatibility fallback compilation without using babel-loader?

Rspack internally uses SWC to perform code downgrade compilation which you can configure by [builtin:swc-loader](/guide/features/builtin-swc-loader.html), so there is no need to use babel-loader to perform code downgrade compilation.

## Is Rspack 100% compatible with webpack API?

No, the goal of Rspack is not to be 100% compatible with 100% of the webpack API. Based on the Pareto principle, we prioritize the implementation of APIs that are commonly used in most projects and support other APIs based on user needs.

## What are the advantages of Rspack compared to webpack + SWC-loader?

Even if webpack + SWC-loader solves the performance problem of babel-loader, webpack itself still has many performance bottlenecks, such as the make and seal stages, which are single-threaded. However, Rspack breaks through these limitations, so Rspack has better performance than webpack + SWC-loader, especially in multi-core scenarios.

## Do custom plugins and custom loaders need to be developed using Rust?

You can develop plugins and loaders using JavaScript, just like developing webpack plugins and loaders. Meanwhile, Rspack also supports developing plugins and loaders using Rust. Please refer to [rspack-binding-template](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rspack-binding-template).

## Does Rspack plan to support React Server Components?

Rspack team is working on supporting React Server Components. Relevant PR: [#12012](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack/pull/12012).
