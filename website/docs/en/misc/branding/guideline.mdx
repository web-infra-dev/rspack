## The Name

When used standalone, Rspack should always be written as Rspack, not rspack or RSPACK or RSPack. However, lowercase letters can be used in command lines or package names, such as `@rspack/cli`.

## Logo

Rspack logo is a small crab as fast as lightning, representing fast compilation of Rspack.
