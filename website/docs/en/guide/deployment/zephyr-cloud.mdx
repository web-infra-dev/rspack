# Deploy with zephyr cloud

[Zephyr Cloud](https://zephyr-cloud.io) is a zero-config deployment platform that integrates directly into your build process and provides global edge distribution for federated applications.

## Features

- **Automatic Deployment**: Automatically deploys your federated applications during the build process - simply save your code and get a URL in seconds.
- **Multi-Bundler Support**: Works with Webpack, Vite, Rspack, and more.
- **Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)**: Deploy using BYOC to any cloud provider.
- **Advanced Deployment Management**: Manages complex multi-artifact deployments across different release cadences, handles micro frontend dependency management automatically, and provides version rollback and roll-forward capabilities.

## How to deploy

1. Install the Zephyr plugin for Rspack:

```bash
npm install zephyr-rspack-plugin --save-dev
```

2. Add the plugin to your Rspack configuration:

```js title="rspack.config.js"
const { withZephyr } = require('zephyr-rspack-plugin');

module.exports = withZephyr()({
  // your existing Rspack configuration
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: __dirname + '/dist',
  },
  // ... rest of your config
});
```

Or if you're using ES modules:

```js title="rspack.config.mjs"
import { withZephyr } from 'zephyr-rspack-plugin';

export default withZephyr()({
  // your existing Rspack configuration
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: __dirname + '/dist',
  },
  // ... rest of your config
});
```

3. Build your project as usual:

```bash
npm run build
```

During the build process, your application will be automatically deployed and you'll receive a deployment URL. Zephyr Cloud handles asset optimization, global CDN distribution, module federation setup, and provides automatic rollback capabilities.
