# Quick start

Get up to speed quickly with a new Rspack based project.

- [Create a new project](#create-a-new-project): Use the CLI to create a brand-new Rspack or Rsbuild project.
- [Migrating from existing projects](#migrating-from-existing-projects): Migrate from a webpack-based project to Rspack.
- [Community ecosystem](#community-ecosystem): Discover projects within the Rspack community ecosystem.

## Setup environment

Before getting started, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= version 16, it is recommended to use the Node.js LTS version.

Check the current Node.js version with the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

If you do not have Node.js installed in current environment, or the installed version is too low, you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to install.

Here is an example of how to install via nvm:

```bash
# Install Node.js LTS
nvm install --lts
# Switch to Node.js LTS
nvm use --lts
```

## Create a new project

### Using Rsbuild

Rsbuild is a high-performance build tool powered by Rspack and developed by the Rspack team. It provides a set of thoughtfully designed default build configs, offering an out-of-the-box development experience and can fully unleash the performance advantages of Rspack.

We recommend using [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/) to create new projects, simply run the following command:

<PackageManagerTabs command="create rsbuild@latest" />

> For more information, refer to [Rsbuild - Quick Start](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/start/quick-start).

### Using the Rspack CLI

Rspack CLI is a tool comparable to Webpack CLI, offering the basic `serve` and `build` commands.

Rsbuild supports Node.js >= 16, but Rspack CLI requires Node.js version >= 18.12.0.

Run the following command to create an Rspack CLI project:

<PackageManagerTabs command="create rspack@latest" />

Then follow the prompts in your terminal.

### Quick Creation

[create-rspack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-rspack) and [create-rsbuild](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-rsbuild) provides some CLI flags. By setting these CLI flags, you can skip the interactive selection steps and create the project with one command.

For example, to create a React project in the `my-project` directory with one command:

```bash
# Rspack CLI
npx create-rspack --dir my-project --template react
# Rsbuild
npx create-rsbuild --dir my-project --template react
# Using abbreviations
npx create-rsbuild -d my-project -t react
```

## Online examples

We provide an online example based on Rsbuild. The example gives an intuitive feel for the build performance of Rspack and the development experience of Rsbuild:

- [Rsbuild CodeSandbox example](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/rspack-contrib/rsbuild-codesandbox-example)

## Manual installation

Start by creating a project directory and generating an npm `package.json':

```bash
mkdir rspack-demo
cd rspack-demo
npm init -y
```

Then installing `@rspack/core` and `@rspack/cli` as dev dependencies:

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rspack/core @rspack/cli -D" />

Update your build scripts to use Rspack CLI:

```js title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "rspack serve",
    "build": "rspack build"
  }
}
```

See [Configure Rspack](/config/index) to learn about how to configure Rspack.

## Migrating from existing projects

If you need to migrate from an existing project to Rspack or Rsbuild, you can refer to the following guides:

- [Migrating from Webpack to Rspack](/guide/migration/webpack)
- [Migrating from Webpack to Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/migration/webpack)
- [Migrating from Create React App to Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/migration/cra)
- [Migrating from Vue CLI to Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/migration/vue-cli)
- [Migrating from Vite to Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/migration/vite)
- [Migrating from Storybook](/guide/migration/storybook)

## Community ecosystem

There are already some Rspack-based toolchains in the community:

- If you want to build a static site, you can try [Rspress](https://rspress.dev).
- If you want to build a library or UI component, you can try [Rslib](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rslib).
- If you want to analyze the build process and build artifacts, you can try [Rsdoctor](https://rsdoctor.dev).
- If you're looking for a full-stack React framework, you can try [Modern.js](https://modernjs.dev/en/).
- If you want a fast and production-ready setup that works in a monorepo, you can try [Nx](https://nx.dev).

> Visit [awesome-rspack](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/awesome-rspack) to discover more projects within the Rspack ecosystem.

### Rspress

Rspress is a static site generator based on Rspack. It provides a complete solution for building static sites and includes the following features:

- ðŸš€ Fast Startup: Based on Rust-based build tool and markdown/mdx compiler, the build speed is extremely fast, bringing you the ultimate development experience.
- ðŸ“š MDX Support: MDX is a powerful way to write content, allowing you to use React components in Markdown.
- ðŸ“¦ Built-in Full Text Search: Automatically generates a full-text search index for you during building process, providing out-of-the-box full-text search capabilities.
- ðŸŒˆ Static Site Generation: In production, it automatically builds into static HTML files, which can be easily deployed anywhere.
- ðŸ”Œ Providing Plugin System: Providing a plugin system, you can customize the build process and theme according to your needs.

Learn more about Rspress in the [official documentation](https://rspress.dev).

### Modern.js

[Modern.js Framework](https://modernjs.dev/en/) is a Rspack-based progressive React framework that provides a complete solution for building web applications. It supports nested routes, server-side rendering, and provides out-of-the-box CSS solutions such as styled components and Tailwind CSS.

Learn more about Modern.js in the [official documentation](https://modernjs.dev/en/guides/get-started/introduction).

### Using Nx

The fastest way to get up to speed quickly and leverage Rspack and React in a production-ready setting is to use the dedicated [Rspack Nx plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nx/rspack). This gives you a pre-configured setup, integrating Rspack with React, TypeScript, ESLint, Jest, and Cypress for e2e testing.

Run the following command to set up a new Nx workspace with React and Rspack:

<Tabs values={[{ label: 'npm' }, { label: 'yarn' }, { label: 'pnpm' }]}>
  <Tab>

```sh
npx create-nx-workspace myrspackapp --preset=@nx/rspack
```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

```sh
yarn create nx-workspace myrspackapp --preset=@nx/rspack --pm=yarn
```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

```sh
pnpm create nx-workspace myrspackapp --preset=@nx/rspack  --pm=pnpm
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The pre-configured setup is already ready to work with Rspack, TypeScript, TSX and React. In addition it also comes with Jest and Cypress for testing and ESLint for linting.

Once created you can simply `npm start` (or `pnpm start` or `yarn start`) to start the development server. You can also run `npm run build` (or `pnpm run build` or `yarn run build`) to build the application for production and similarly run `npm run test` (or `pnpm run test` or `yarn run test`) to run the unit tests.

> You can learn more about Nx at [https://nx.dev](https://nx.dev).
