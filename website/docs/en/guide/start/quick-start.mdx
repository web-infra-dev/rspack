# Quick start

Get up to speed quickly with a new Rspack based project.

- [Create a new project](#create-a-new-project): Use the CLI to create a brand-new Rspack or Rsbuild project.
- [Migrating from existing projects](#migrating-from-existing-projects): Migrate from a webpack-based project to Rspack.
- [Community ecosystem](#community-ecosystem): Discover projects within the Rspack community ecosystem.

## Setup environment

Rsbuild supports using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Deno](https://deno.com/), or [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as the runtime.

### Node.js

For Node.js, please install Node.js >= 16, it is recommended to use the Node.js LTS version.

Check the current Node.js version with the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

If you do not have Node.js installed in current environment, or the installed version is too low, you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to install.

Here is an example of how to install via nvm:

```bash
# Install Node.js LTS
nvm install --lts
# Switch to Node.js LTS
nvm use --lts
```

### Using Rsbuild

Rsbuild is a high-performance build tool powered by Rspack and developed by the Rspack team. It provides a set of thoughtfully designed default build configs, offering an out-of-the-box development experience and can fully unleash the performance advantages of Rspack.

We recommend using [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/) to create new projects, simply run the following command:

<PackageManagerTabs command="create rsbuild@latest" />

> For more information, refer to [Rsbuild - Quick Start](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/start/quick-start).

### Using the Rspack CLI

Rspack CLI is a tool comparable to Webpack CLI, offering the basic `serve` and `build` commands.

Rsbuild supports Node.js >= 16, but Rspack CLI requires Node.js version >= 18.12.0.

Run the following command to create an Rspack CLI project:

<PackageManagerTabs command="create rspack@latest" />

Then follow the prompts in your terminal.

### Quick Creation

[create-rspack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-rspack) and [create-rsbuild](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-rsbuild) provides some CLI flags. By setting these CLI flags, you can skip the interactive selection steps and create the project with one command.

For example, to create a React project in the `my-project` directory with one command:

```bash
# Rspack CLI
npx create-rspack --dir my-project --template react
# Rsbuild
npx create-rsbuild --dir my-project --template react
# Using abbreviations
npx create-rsbuild -d my-project -t react
```

## Online examples

We provide an online example based on Rsbuild. The example gives an intuitive feel for the build performance of Rspack and the development experience of Rsbuild:

- [Rsbuild CodeSandbox example](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/rspack-contrib/rsbuild-codesandbox-example)

## Manual installation

Start by creating a project directory and generating an npm `package.json':

```bash
mkdir rspack-demo
cd rspack-demo
npm init -y
```

Then installing `@rspack/core` and `@rspack/cli` as dev dependencies:

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rspack/core @rspack/cli -D" />

Update your build scripts to use Rspack CLI:

```js title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "rspack serve",
    "build": "rspack build"
  }
}
```

See [Configure Rspack](/config/index) to learn about how to configure Rspack.
