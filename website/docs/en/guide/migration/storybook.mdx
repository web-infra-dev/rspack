# Migrate from Storybook webpack

If you are using React / Vue with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and building with webpack 5, you can replace the `@storybook/react-webpack5` build with [storybook-rsbuild](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/storybook-rsbuild), which is implemented based on Rsbuild and uses Rspack as the underlying bundler. It supports out-of-the-box use, and the documentation can be found at [storybook-rsbuild](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/storybook-rsbuild).

Next, we will take React as an example to introduce how to migrate a Storybook webpack 5 project. The migration steps for Vue projects are similar to React.

:::info

Storybook Rsbuild requires at least version 8.0 of Storybook. It's highly recommended to upgrade Storybook to the latest version, check Storybook 8's [release note](https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-8/) for detail changes and migration guide.

:::

## Update Dependencies

First, replace `@storybook/react-webpack5` with [`storybook-react-rsbuild`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/storybook-react-rsbuild) (for Vue projects, use [`storybook-vue3-rsbuild`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/storybook-vue3-rsbuild)), add `@rsbuild/core` and `@rsbuild/plugin-react` (for Vue projects, use `@rsbuild/plugin-vue`).

<PackageManagerTabs command="install storybook-react-rsbuild @rsbuild/core @rsbuild/plugin-react -D" />

## Configure Rsbuild

Storybook Rsbuild will automatically load the Rsbuild configuration file from the working directory. Install [`@rsbuild/plugin-react`](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/framework/react) (for Vue projects, install and use [`@rsbuild/plugin-vue`](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/framework/vue3)).

```js
import { defineConfig } from '@rsbuild/core';
import { pluginReact } from '@rsbuild/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [pluginReact()],
});
```

## Update Storybook Configuration

Refer to the following configuration to modify the `main.js` configuration of Storybook, and specify `'storybook-react-rsbuild'` as the Storybook framework (for Vue projects, use `'storybook-vue3-rsbuild'`).

```diff title=.storybook/main.js
export default {
-  framework: '@storybook/react-webpack5'
+  framework: 'storybook-react-rsbuild',
  },
```

## Examples

The [rspack-contrib/storybook-rsbuild](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/storybook-rsbuild/tree/main/sandboxes) repository provides examples of Storybook for React / Vue projects.

## Limitations

Rspack is gradually improving full support for Storybook. Currently, there are some capabilities that are not supported, see [storybook-rsbuild - Roadmap](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/storybook-rsbuild#roadmap) for details.
