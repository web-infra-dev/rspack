# Migrating from Rspack 0.x

The document lists all breaking changes from Rspack v0.7 to v1.0. You can refer to this document for migration.

> See [Breaking changes in Rspack v1.0.0](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack/discussions/6626) for details.

## Configuration Default Value Adjustments

In Rspack 1.x, we have aligned the default configuration values with those of Webpack.

### [Important] experiments.css

The default value has been changed from `true` to `false`.

In Rspack 0.x, `experiments.css` was enabled by default, which means files ending with `*.css` were automatically treated as `type: 'css/auto'` without needing to manually include other loaders to process CSS files.

If you rely on this built-in capability, you now need to manually enable `experiments.css`.

### [Important] optimization.concatenateModules

The default value has been changed from `false` to:

- `true` when `mode` is `'production'`.
- `false` for other values of `mode`.

In Rspack 1.x, module concatenation optimization has become more stable. Thus, it's now enabled by default in production mode, allowing multiple modules to be concatenated into a single module to reduce output size and improve compression efficiency.

### devtool

The default value has been changed from `false` to:

- `eval` when `mode` is `'development'`.
- `false` for other values of `mode`.

### experiments.asyncWebAssembly

The default value has been changed from `false` to depend on the `experiments.futureDefaults` configuration. It is enabled by default only when `experiments.futureDefaults` is set to `true`.

If you are using WebAssembly modules as asynchronous modules, you now need to manually set `experiments.asyncWebAssembly` to `true`.

### splitChunks.cacheGroups.\{cacheGroup\}.reuseExistingChunk

The default value has been changed from `true` to `false`.

### optimization.moduleIds

The default value has been changed to `'natural'` when `mode` is `none`.

### optimization.chunkIds

The default value has been changed to `'natural'` when `mode` is `none`.

## Removed Configurations

### [Important] Removed resolve.tsConfigPath

Please use [resolve.tsConfig](/config/resolve#resolvetsconfig) instead.

### output.amdContainer

Please use [output.library.amdContainer](/config/output#outputlibraryamdcontainer) instead.

## Adjustments to builtin:swc-loader

To streamline the core, Rspack 1.x has removed the built-in SWC plugins. You now need to manually include them.

### [Important] Removed rspackExperiments.styledComponents

Use [@swc/plugin-styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swc/plugin-styled-components) instead.

```diff
export default {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx$/,
        loader: "builtin:swc-loader",
        options: {
-         rspackExperiments: {
-           styledComponents: true,
-         },
          jsc: {
+           experimental: {
+             plugins: [["@swc/plugin-styled-components", {}]],
+           },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### [Important] Removed rspackExperiments.emotion

Use [@swc/plugin-emotion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swc/plugin-emotion) instead.

```diff
export default {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx$/,
        loader: "builtin:swc-loader",
        options: {
-         rspackExperiments: {
-           emotion: true,
-         },
          jsc: {
+           experimental: {
+             plugins: [["@swc/plugin-emotion", {}]],
+           },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### [Important] Removed rspackExperiments.relay

Use [@swc/plugin-relay](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swc/plugin-relay) instead.

```diff
export default {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx$/,
        loader: "builtin:swc-loader",
        options: {
-         rspackExperiments: {
-           relay: true,
-         },
          jsc: {
+           experimental: {
+             plugins: [["@swc/plugin-relay", {}]],
+           },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### [Important] Removed rspackExperiments.preact

Use [@swc/plugin-prefresh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swc/plugin-prefresh) instead.

```diff
export default {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx$/,
        loader: "builtin:swc-loader",
        options: {
-         rspackExperiments: {
-           preact: true,
-         },
          jsc: {
+           experimental: {
+             plugins: [["@swc/plugin-prefresh", {}]],
+           },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

## Adjustments to Built-in Plugins

### rspack.SwcJsMinimizerRspackPlugin

Rspack's built-in and default-enabled JavaScript minimizer plugin has had its configuration aligned with [SWC's minification configuration](https://swc.rs/docs/configuration/minification). The breaking changes are as follows:

- `minimizerOptions.passes`: moved to `minimizerOptions.compress.passes`
- `minimizerOptions.dropConsole`: moved to `minimizerOptions.compress.drop_console`
- `minimizerOptions.pureFuncs`: moved to `minimizerOptions.compress.pure_funcs`
- `minimizerOptions.keepClassNames`: moved to `minimizerOptions.mangle.keep_classnames`
- `minimizerOptions.keepFnNames`: moved to `minimizerOptions.mangle.keep_fnames`
- `minimizerOptions.comments`: moved to `minimizerOptions.format.comments`
- `minimizerOptions.asciiOnly`: moved to `minimizerOptions.format.ascii_only`

Default Value Changes:

- `comments` (`options.format.comments`): changed from `false` to `"some"`

### rspack.HtmlRspackPlugin

We have aligned its configuration with [html-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin), with the following breaking changes:

- `excludedChunks` has been renamed to `excludeChunks`
- When `mode` is `'production'`, `minify` is now `true` by default

## Other Changes

### [Important] @rspack/cli

`@rspack/cli` has upgraded its dependency on `webpack-dev-server` from v4 to v5. If you are using `@rspack/cli`, please be aware of the following breaking changes:

- The minimum supported Node.js version for webpack-dev-server v5 is 18.12.0.
- Several configuration options have changed. Please refer to the [webpack-dev-server v5 migration guide](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/master/migration-v5.md).

### [Important] ResolverFactory and Resolver Refactoring with Rust

`ResolverFactory` and `Resolver` have been refactored with Rust to unify the implementations on the JS and Rust sides. Due to this change, `ResolverFactory` and `Resolver` currently do not support any hooks.

Additionally, `Resolver` now only supports the following methods:

- `resolveSync`
- `resolve`
- `withOptions`

This change might cause some plugins to become unusable.
