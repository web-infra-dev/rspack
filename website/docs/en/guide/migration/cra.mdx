# Migrate from Create React App

Since Create React App (CRA) comes with rich built-in capabilities, it would be challenging to manually set up an equivalent configuration using Rspack CLI. Therefore, we recommend migrating your CRA application to [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/) to leverage Rspack's capabilities out of the box.

## What is Rsbuild

Rsbuild is a high-performance build tool powered by Rspack. It provides a set of thoughtfully designed default build configs, offering an out-of-the-box development experience and can fully unleash the performance advantages of Rspack.

Rsbuild provides rich build features, including the compilation of TypeScript, JSX, Sass, Less, CSS Modules, Wasm, and others. It also supports Module Federation, image compression, type checking, PostCSS, Lightning CSS, and more.
