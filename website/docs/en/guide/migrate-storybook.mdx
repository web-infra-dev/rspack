# Migrate Storybook

If you're using [Storybook 7.0](https://storybook.js.org/) for React with Webpack5, it's possible to use Rspack using an experimental [builder](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/builders/overview).

## Updating dependencies

First, we need to add `storybook-react-rspack` dependency, and uninstall the `@storybook/react-webpack5` dependency.

```diff title=package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
-   "@storybook/react-webpack5": "^7"
+   "storybook-react-rspack": "latest"
  }}
```

## Configure Storybook

Then, make the corresponding change to the Storybook `main.js` config:

```diff title=.storybook/main.js
export default {
-  framework: '@storybook/react-webpack5'
+  framework: 'storybook-react-rspack'
}
```

## Example

There is a example here [react-storybook](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rspack-examples/tree/main/rspack/react-storybook)

## Limitations

Support for Storybook 7.0 is still experimental, and there are some limitations:

1. There is no support for non-React frameworks,
2. There is no support for NextJS, which is its own framework

There is also incomplete docgen support to automatically generate controls from components.
Rspack is currently compatible with the following `main.js` configuration, however this has known issues and is a work in progress.

```js
export default {
  typescript: {
    reactDocgen: 'react-docgen',
  },
};
```
