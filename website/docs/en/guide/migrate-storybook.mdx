# Migrate Storybook

If you are using the React framework of [Storybook 7.0](https://storybook.js.org/) and building with Webpack 5, you can replace the `@storybook/react-webpack5` with [@modern-js/storybook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modern-js/storybook), which supports Rspack as an out-of-the-box underlying build tool. Documentation can be referred to at [Modern.js - Using Storybook](https://modernjs.dev/en/guides/advanced-features/using-storybook.html).

## Update Dependencies

First, we need to add the `@modern-js/storybook` dependency and remove the `webpack` dependency.

```diff title=package.json
{
  "devDependencies": {
-   "@storybook/react-webpack5": "^7"
+   "@modern-js/storybook": "^2"
  }
}
```

## Configure Storybook

Refer to the following configuration, modify the `main.js` configuration of Storybook, and specify Rspack as the build tool:

```diff title=.storybook/main.js
export default {
-  framework: '@storybook/react-webpack5'
+  framework: {
+    name: '@modern-js/storybook',
+    options: {
+      bundler: 'rspack'
+    },
  },
```

## Example

Here is an example of building Storybook with Rspack based on @modern-js/storybook: [react-storybook](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rspack-examples/tree/main/rspack/react-storybook).

## Limitations

Support for Storybook 7.0 is still experimental, and there are currently some limitations:

1. Support for frameworks other than React is not yet available.
2. Support for Next.js is not available, as Next.js has its own build solution.
3. If you find the build speed is very slow, check if the automatic documentation generation feature is enabled. For the highest performance, configure it to `react-docgen`. The difference between `react-docgen` and `react-docgen-typescript` is that the former is based on Babel, while the latter is based on TypeScript. The former has better performance, but weaker type inference capabilities. If using Rspack to build, only `react-docgen` is supported.

   ```js title=main.js
   export default {
     typescript: {
       reactDocgen: 'react-docgen',
     },
   };
   ```

We plan to provide a framework-agnostic builder based on [Rsbuild](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rsbuild) to integrate with the framework, refer to [rsbuild#1974](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rsbuild/issues/1974).
