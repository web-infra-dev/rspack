# HTML

Use the following plugins to simplify the creation of HTML files and automatically inject the generated CSS and JavaScript files into the HTML.
This is especially useful for `Rspack` bundles that include a hash in the filename which changes every compilation.

## HtmlWebpackPlugin

Rspack fully supports [HtmlWebpackPlugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin).

```js title="rspack.config.js"
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: 'index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, './dist'),
    filename: 'index_bundle.js',
  },
  plugins: [new HtmlWebpackPlugin()],
};
```

For all configuration options, see the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin#options).

## HtmlRspackPlugin

[HtmlRspackPlugin](/plugins/rspack/html-rspack-plugin) is a high-performance HTML plugin implemented in Rust, offering significantly better build performance than the `HtmlWebpackPlugin`, especially when building a large number of HTML files.

```js title="rspack.config.js"
const rspack = require('@rspack/core');

module.exports = {
  entry: 'index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, './dist'),
    filename: 'index_bundle.js',
  },
  plugins: [new rspack.HtmlRspackPlugin()],
};
```

For all configuration options, see the [plugin documentation](/plugins/rspack/html-rspack-plugin).
