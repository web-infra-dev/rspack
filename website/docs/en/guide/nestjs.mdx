# NestJS

Rspack not only supports building frontend projects but also supports building Node.js App like NestJS.
Rspack provides NestJS [example](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rspack-examples/tree/main/rspack/nestjs) for reference.

## Native node modules

When building Node.js applications with Rspack, you may encounter dependencies that include Node.js native addon dependencies (.node modules). Because .node modules cannot be packaged into JavaScript artifacts, special handling is usually required. node-loader can be used to handle addon packaging very well.

```js title="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rule: [
      {
        test: /\.node$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'node-loader',
            options: {
              name: '[path][name].[ext]',
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```
