Module Federation allows JavaScript applications to dynamically load code from other builds at runtime.
This feature has several use cases, including:

- Independent applications (known as "microfrontends" in microfrontend architecture) to share modules without the need to recompile the entire application.
- Distributed teams to work on different parts of the same application without the need to recompile the entire application.
- Dynamic code loading and sharing between applications during runtime

Rspack supports two versions of Module Federation: Module Federation 1.0 and Module Federation 1.5.

- Module Federation 1.0 is the current implementation of ModuleFederationPlugin in Webpack.
- Module Federation 1.5, among other things, adds runtime plugin functionality to 1.0, allowing for the extension of Module Federation's behavior, functionality, and providing control inversion to users.

- [ModuleFederationPluginV1](/plugins/webpack/module-federation-plugin-v1)
