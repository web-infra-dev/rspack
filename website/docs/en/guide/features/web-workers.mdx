# Web Workers

<ApiMeta addedVersion={'0.2.6'} />

[Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) are first-class citizens of Rspack, which means you don't need any loader to use Web Workers directly.

## Usage

```js
new Worker(new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url));
```

```js
new Worker(new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url), {
  name: 'my-worker', // <-- When the value of the name property can be statically analyzed, the worker's chunk name can be customized with this property to replace the [name] placeholder when the chunk file is generated
});
```

In addition to `new Worker()`, the following syntax is also supported:

- `new SharedWorker()`
- `import { Worker } from "worker_threads"`: usually used in Node environments
- <ApiMeta addedVersion={'1.0.0-alpha.0'} inline /> `navigator.serviceWorker.register()`:
  used to register Service Workers

Custom syntax can be provided via [`module.parser.javascript.worker`](/config/module#moduleparserjavascriptworker).

For examples:

- [examples/worker](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rspack-examples/tree/main/rspack/worker)
- [examples/monaco-editor-js](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rspack-examples/tree/main/rspack/monaco-editor-js)
- [examples/monaco-editor-ts-react](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rspack-examples/tree/main/rspack/monaco-editor-ts-react)

:::info
The syntax was chosen to allow running code without bundler, it is also available in native ECMAScript modules in the browser.
:::

:::warning

1. Note that `new Worker` can also accept a string representation of a URL, but only passing in URLs is supported in Rspack.
2. Rspack does not support the use of variables in `new Worker`. For example, the following code will not work:

   ```js
   const url = new URL('./path/to/worker.js', import.meta.url);
   const worker = new Worker(url);
   ```

   This is because Rspack cannot statically analyze the syntax. Please be sure to note this limitation when using the Worker syntax in Rspack.

3. Not support `/* webpackEntryOptions: { filename: "workers/[name].js" } */` magic comments for now.

## worker-loader

<ApiMeta addedVersion={'0.7.4'} />

:::warning
worker-loader is provided only as a temporary solution to facilitate project migration to Rspack. It is recommended to use the `new Worker()` syntax instead.
:::

Rspack also supports worker-loader. However, since [worker-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/worker-loader) is no longer maintained, please use [worker-rspack-loader](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/worker-rspack-loader) as a replacement.

Use [resolveLoader](/config/resolve-loader) to replace worker-loader with worker-rspack-loader:

```js
module.exports = {
  resolveLoader: {
    alias: {
      'worker-loader': require.resolve('worker-rspack-loader'),
    },
  },
};
```
