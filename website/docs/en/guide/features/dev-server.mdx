# DevServer

Rspack CLI comes with a built-in `@rspack/dev-server` for development and debugging. Its capabilities are similar to `webpack-dev-server`, including features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR), proxy server and more.

:::tip

`webpack-dev-server@5` is used in `@rspack/dev-server`, which has some differences from `webpack-dev-server@4`.

- The minimum supported Node.js version for webpack-dev-server v5 is 18.12.0.
- Several configuration options have changed. Please refer to the [webpack-dev-server v5 migration guide](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/master/migration-v5.md).

:::

### HMR

By default, Rspack enables HMR in dev mode. You can disable HMR by configuring the `devServer.hot` option in `rspack.config.js`.

```js
module.exports = {
  devServer: {
    hot: false,
  },
};
```

:::warning
HMR is not working for CSS when `output.cssFilename` contains `[hash]` or `[contenthash]`

### Proxy

Rspack has a built-in simple proxy server. You can enable the proxy server by configuring the `devServer.proxy` option in `rspack.config.js`. The devServer internally uses [http-proxy-middleware](https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware) to implement the proxy function. For example, you can proxy `/api` to `http://localhost:3000` as follows:

```js
module.exports = {
  devServer: {
    proxy: [
      {
        context: ['/api'],
        target: 'http://localhost:3000',
        changeOrigin: true,
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

For more devServer configuration options, please refer to [devServer](/config/dev-server.html).
