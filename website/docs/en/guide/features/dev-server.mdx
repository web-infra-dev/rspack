# DevServer

Rspack CLI comes with a built-in `@rspack/dev-server` for development and debugging. Its capabilities are similar to `webpack-dev-server`, including features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR), proxy server and more.

### HMR

By default, Rspack enables HMR in dev mode. You can disable HMR by configuring the `devServer.hot` option in `rspack.config.js`.

```js
module.exports = {
  devServer: {
    hot: false,
  },
};
```

:::warning
HMR is not working for css when `output.cssFilename` contains `[hash]` or `[contenthash]`
:::

### Proxy

Rspack has a built-in simple proxy server. You can enable the proxy server by configuring the `devServer.proxy` option in `rspack.config.js`. The devServer internally uses [http-proxy-middleware](https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware) to implement the proxy function. For example, you can proxy `/api` to `http://localhost:3000` as follows:

```js
module.exports = {
  devServer: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'http://localhost:3000',
        changeOrigin: true,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

For more devServer configuration options, please refer to [devServer](/config/dev-server.html).
