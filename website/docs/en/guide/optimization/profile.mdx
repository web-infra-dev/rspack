## Rspack Profile

<ApiMeta addedVersion={'0.3.0'} />

The Rspack CLI supports the use of the `RSPACK_PROFILE` environment variable for build performance profile.

```sh
$ RSPACK_PROFILE=ALL rspack build
```

This command will generate a `.rspack-profile-${timestamp}-${pid}` folder in the current folder, and it will contain `logging.json`, `trace.json` and `jscpuprofile.json` files.

- `trace.json`: The time spent on each phase of the Rust side is recorded at a granular level using [tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) and can be viewed using [ui.perfetto.dev](https://ui.perfetto.dev/)
- `jscpuprofile.json`: The time spent at each stage on the JavaScript side is recorded at a granular level using [Node.js inspector](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/inspector.html) and can be viewed using [speedscope.app](https://www.speedscope.app/)
- `logging.json`: Includes some logging information that keeps a coarse-grained record of how long each phase of the build took

## Rsdoctor's Compilation Analysis

Rsdoctor is a build analyser that can visually display the compilation time of each loaders and plugins.

#### Loader Timeline

If you need to analyze the time cost of loaders and plugins, or the compilation behavior of loaders, you can use Rsdoctor to view:

You can view the execution time of each loader and the files that were compiled, as well as the time taken for each file, in the timeline.

Refer to [Loader Timeline](https://rsdoctor.dev/guide/usage/loaders-timeline).

#### Loader Details

If you want to view the compilation process of loaders, you can use the [Loader Details](https://rsdoctor.dev/guide/usage/loaders-analysis):

On this report page, you can see the code changes made by the loaders for each file before and after compilation.

Refer to [Loader Details](https://rsdoctor.dev/guide/usage/loaders-analysis).

#### Enable Compilation Analysis

To enable `RsdoctorRspackPlugin`, you can refer to the documentation: [Use Rsdoctor](/guide/optimization/use-rsdoctor).

- The `RsdoctorRspackPlugin` requires the `features.loader` and `features.plugins` parameters to be set to `true`. By default, `features.loader` and `features.plugins` are enabled. Refer to the parameter documentation [Rsdoctor options](https://rsdoctor.dev/config/options/options#features).
- Usage documentation:
  - For Loader Analysis, refer to [Loader Timeline](https://rsdoctor.dev/guide/usage/loaders-timeline) and [Loader Details](https://rsdoctor.dev/guide/usage/loaders-analysis).
  - For Plugins Analysis, refer to [Plugin Analysis](https://rsdoctor.dev/guide/usage/plugins-analysis).
