### More about Features

You can see more details of features from this wiki: [Rsdoctor Features](https://rsdoctor.dev/guide/start/features).

### Bundle Analysis

You can use Rsdoctor for **[Bundle Analysis](/guide/optimization/analysis#rsdoctors-bundle-analysis)** in Rspack.

### Compilation Analysis

Rsdoctor is a build analyzer that can visually display the compilation time of each loader and plugin. See [Compilation Analysis](/guide/optimization/profile#rsdoctors-compilation-analysis) for more details.

## Quick Start

In an Rspack-based project, you can enable Rsdoctor as follows:

1. Install the Rsdoctor plugin:

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rsdoctor/rspack-plugin -D" />

2. Register the `RsdoctorRspackPlugin` plugin:

:::danger

- Please do not use Rsdoctor in production version.

:::

Initialize the RsdoctorRspackPlugin plugin in the [plugins](/config/plugins.html#plugins) section of `rspack.config.js`, as shown below:

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
const { RsdoctorRspackPlugin } = require('@rsdoctor/rspack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    process.env.RSDOCTOR &&
      new RsdoctorRspackPlugin({
        // plugin options
      }),
  ].filter(Boolean),
};
```

3. Add `RSDOCTOR=true` env variable before the CLI command:

```bash
# dev
RSDOCTOR=true rspack serve

# build
RSDOCTOR=true rspack build
```

After running the above commands, when the build is completed, it will open the build analysis page. For complete features, please refer to [Rsdoctor document](https://rsdoctor.dev/).

4. **[Optional]** Configure Options

You can refer to this document [**options**](https://rsdoctor.dev/config/options/options) for parameter configuration of the RsdoctorRspackPlugin.
