## Quick start

In an Rspack-based project, you can enable Rsdoctor as follows:

1. Install the Rsdoctor plugin:

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rsdoctor/rspack-plugin -D" />

2. Register the `RsdoctorRspackPlugin` plugin:

:::danger

- Please do not use Rsdoctor in production version.

:::

Initialize the RsdoctorRspackPlugin plugin in the [plugins](/config/plugins.html#plugins) field of Rspack configuration, as shown below:

```ts title="rspack.config.mjs"
import { RsdoctorRspackPlugin } from '@rsdoctor/rspack-plugin';

export default {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    process.env.RSDOCTOR &&
      new RsdoctorRspackPlugin({
        // plugin options
      }),
  ],
};
```

3. Add `RSDOCTOR=true` env variable before the CLI command:

```bash
# dev
RSDOCTOR=true rspack serve

# build
RSDOCTOR=true rspack build
```

After running the above commands, when the build is completed, it will open the build analysis page. For complete features, please refer to [Rsdoctor document](https://rsdoctor.dev/).

4. **[Optional]** Configure Options
