# Production

## Source Mapping

It is recommended to enable SourceMap for production environments to facilitate debugging in production environments. If you have a large project, it is recommended that you choose a configuration with better performance (see [devtool](config/devtool) for more options), such as the `source-map` configuration option.

## Minification

During the production build, Rspack uses the built-in minimizer to minify JavaScript and CSS code by default. You can use [SwcJsMinimizerRspackPlugin](/plugins/rspack/swc-js-minimizer-rspack-plugin) and [LightningCssMinimizerRspackPlugin](/plugins/rspack/lightning-css-minimizer-rspack-plugin) for configuration.

```js title=rspack.config.js
const rspack = require('@rspack/core');

module.exports = {
  optimization: {
    minimizer: [
      new rspack.SwcJsMinimizerRspackPlugin({
        // JS minimizer configuration
      }),
      new rspack.LightningCssMinimizerRspackPlugin({
        // CSS minimizer configuration
      }),
    ],
  },
};
```

If the built-in minimizer cannot meet your needs, you can also use [optimization.minimizer](/config/optimization#optimizationminimizer) to set custom minimizers.
