# Bundle analysis

Rspack's Command Line Interface (CLI) supports bundle analysis out-of-box via the `--analyze` option. It uses [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer) behind the scenes.

```sh
$ rspack build --analyze
```

You can also generate a `stats.json` file for further analysis with other bundle analysis tools like [bundle-stats](https://github.com/relative-ci/bundle-stats) or [statoscope](https://statoscope.tech/):

```sh
$ rspack build --json stats.json
```
