# Rspack plugins

Rspack enhances its compilation capabilities through a rich ecosystem of plugins. These plugins fall into the following categories:

## Built-in plugins

Rspack provides several high-performance built-in plugins. They can serve as drop-in replacements for popular plugins in the webpack ecosystem and deliver more efficient performance.

Including:

- [CircularDependencyRspackPlugin](/plugins/rspack/circular-dependency-rspack-plugin): Flags circular imports
- [CopyRspackPlugin](/plugins/rspack/copy-rspack-plugin): Copies files or directories to the build output
- [CssChunkingPlugin](/plugins/rspack/css-chunking-plugin): Splits CSS while preserving import order to avoid style issues

- [VirtualModulesPlugin](/plugins/rspack/virtual-modules-plugin): Creates and modifies virtual modules in memory

## Built-in plugins (webpack-aligned)

To align with webpack's functionality, Rspack has replicated most of webpack's built-in plugins. They maintain the same naming and configuration parameters as closely as possible and provide the same features.

See [Built-in plugins (webpack-aligned) - Overview](/plugins/webpack/index) for more details.

## Community plugins

Rspack strives to maintain compatibility with the webpack plugin ecosystem to leverage the excellent features that have been accumulated and validated by the community.
