## Rspack's Unique Built-in Plugins

Combining its own implementation characteristics, Rspack offers several unique plugins as alternatives to corresponding plugins from the webpack ecosystem, aiming to deliver more efficient performance.

## Compatible Plugins from the webpack Ecosystem

Rspack strives to achieve full compatibility with the webpack ecosystem, allowing users to seamlessly use plugins from the webpack ecosystem.
