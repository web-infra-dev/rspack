# EntryPlugin

Adds an entry chunk on compilation. The chunk is named `options.name` and contains only one module (plus dependencies). The module is resolved from `entry` in `context` (absolute path).

```js
new rspack.EntryPlugin(context, entry, options);
```

## Options

### context

The module is resolved from `entry` in `context` (absolute path).

- **Type:** `string`

### entry

The module path for the entry module.

- **Type:** `string`

### options

To adjust settings related to the entry module.

- **Type:**

```ts
type EntryOptions =
  | string
  | (Omit<EntryDescriptionNormalized, 'import'> & {
      /**
       * The name of the entry chunk.
       */
      name?: string;
    });
```

If `options` is a string, its value will be used as `name`.

Refer to [Entry description object](/config/entry#entry-description-object) for all available options.

## Global entry

When the plugin's `name` option is set to `undefined`, the entry is treated as a global entry. It's automatically injected into:

1. All regular entry chunks
2. All asynchronous entries (for example, worker chunks created with `new Worker()`)

This allows you to inject global runtime code, such as the dev server's HMR runtime or the initialization logic for module federation.

```js
new rspack.EntryPlugin(
  context,
  './global-runtime.js',
  { name: undefined }
);
```
