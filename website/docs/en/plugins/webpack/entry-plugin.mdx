# EntryPlugin

Adds an entry chunk on compilation. The chunk is named `options.name` and contains only one module (plus dependencies). The module is resolved from `entry` in `context` (absolute path).

```js
new rspack.EntryPlugin(context, entry, options);
```

## Options

### context

The module is resolved from `entry` in `context` (absolute path).

- **Type:** `string`

### entry

The module path for the entry module.

- **Type:** `string`

### options

To adjust settings related to the entry module.

- **Type:**

```ts
type EntryOptions =
  | string
  | (Omit<EntryDescriptionNormalized, 'import'> & {
      /**
       * The name of the entry chunk.
       */
      name?: string;
    });
```

If `options` is a string, its value will be used as `name`.

Please refer to [Entry Description Object](/config/entry#entry-description-object) for all available options.

## Global Entry

When `options.name` is `undefined`, the entry is treated as a **global entry**. Global entries are special entries whose dependencies and included dependencies are injected into:

1. **Regular entrypoints** - Normal entry chunks
2. **Async entrypoints** - Entry chunks created by `new Worker()` or other async entry mechanisms

This behavior ensures that global dependencies (such as those added by webpack-dev-server for hot module replacement, or by ModuleFederationPlugin for runtime initialization) are available in all contexts, including Web Workers.

### Use Cases

Global entries are typically used by:

- **webpack-dev-server**: Injects HMR (Hot Module Replacement) runtime code
- **ModuleFederationPlugin**: Injects Module Federation runtime initialization code
- **Custom plugins**: Can inject code that needs to be available across all entry contexts

### Example

```js
// Creating a global entry (name is undefined)
new rspack.EntryPlugin(
  context,
  './global-runtime.js',
  { name: undefined }
);

// This global entry will be included in both:
// - Regular entry chunks
// - Worker entry chunks created with new Worker()
```
