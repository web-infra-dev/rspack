# Modules

While Rspack supports multiple module syntaxes, we recommend following a single syntax for consistency and to avoid odd behaviors/bugs.

### ES6 (Recommended)

Rspack support ES6 module syntax natively, you can use static `import`, `export` and `import()` syntax.

#### Magic Comments

By adding comments to the import, we can do things such as name our chunk or select different modes.

```js
import(
  /* webpackChunkName: "my-chunk-name" */
  /* webpackPrefetch: true */
  /* webpackPreload: true */
  'module'
);
```

`webpackChunkName`: A name for the new chunk.

`webpackPrefetch`: Tells the browser that the resource is probably needed for some navigation in the future (Available since 0.4.5).

`webpackPreload`: Tells the browser that the resource might be needed during the current navigation (Available since 0.4.5).

### CommonJS

Rspack is also support `CommonJS` syntax natively, you can use `require` and `module.exports` syntax.

### DataURI Module

Rspack supports importing DataURI modules using the `import` and `require` syntax.

**import**

```js
import DataURI from 'data:text/javascript,export default 42';
```

**require**

```js
require('data:text/javascript,module.exports = 42');
```

In addition, Base64 encoded requests are also supported:

```js
const {
  number,
  fn,
} = require('data:text/javascript;charset=utf-8;base64,ZXhwb3J0IGNvbnN0IG51bWJlciA9IDQyOwpleHBvcnQgZnVuY3Rpb24gZm4oKSB7CiAgcmV0dXJuICJIZWxsbyB3b3JsZCI7Cn0=');
```

::: tip
The DataURI module can be used as a method to implement virtual modules, such as combining with a Loader to dynamically load custom modules at runtime.
:::

### Webpack

Aside from the module syntaxes described above, Rspack also support some webpack-specific methods.

#### require.context

```ts
require.context(
  (directory: String),
  (includeSubdirs: Boolean) /* optional, default true */,
  (filter: RegExp) /* optional, default /^\.\/.*$/, any file */,
  (mode: String) /* optional, 'sync' | 'eager' | 'weak' | 'lazy' | 'lazy-once', default 'sync' */
);
```

Specify a whole group of dependencies using a path to the `directory`, an option to `includeSubdirs`, a filter for more fine grained control of the modules included, and a mode to define the way how loading will work.
If mode is set to 'lazy', the underlying modules will be loaded asynchronously.

## Module Variables

### module.hot (webpack-specific)

Indicates whether or not Hot Module Replacement is enabled and provides an interface to the process. See the [HMR API page](/api/hmr) for details.

### import.meta.webpackHot (webpack-specific)

An alias for `module.hot`, however `import.meta.webpackHot` can be used in strict ESM while module.hot can't.

### \_\_dirname (NodeJS)

Depending on the configuration option `node.__dirname`:

- false: Not defined
- mock: equal to '/'
- true: node.js \_\_dirname
  If used inside an expression that is parsed by the Parser, the configuration option is treated as true.

### \_\_resourceQuery (webpack-specific)

The resource query of the current module. If the following require call was made, then the query string would be available in file.js.

```ts
require('file.js?test');
```

```ts title="file.js"
__resourceQuery === '?test';
```

### \_\_webpack_modules\_\_ (webpack-specific)

Access to the internal object of all modules.

### \_\_webpack_hash\_\_ (webpack-specific)

It provides access to the hash of the compilation.

### \_\_webpack_public_path\_\_ (webpack-specific)

Equals the configuration option's [`output.publicPath`](/config/output#outputpublicpath).

### \_\_webpack_chunkname\_\_ (webpack-specific)

<ApiMeta addedVersion="0.4.4" />

Access to name of current chunk.

### \_\_webpack_runtime_id\_\_ (webpack-specific)

<ApiMeta addedVersion="0.4.4" />

Access the runtime id of current entry.
