# Rspack specific properties

The loader interface provides all module relate information. However in rare cases you might need access to the compiler api itself.

Please note that using these webpack specific properties will have a negative impact on your loaders compatibility.

Therefore you should only use them as a last resort. Using them will reduce the portability of your loader.
