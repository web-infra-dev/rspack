# Compiler internal specific properties

The loader interface provides all module relate information. However in rare cases you might need access to the compiler API itself.

:::warning
Please note that using these Rspack specific properties will have a negative impact on your loaders compatibility.

Therefore you should only use them as a last resort. Using them will reduce the portability of your loader.
