# The Loader Context

The loader context represents the properties that are available inside of a loader assigned to the `this` property.


## `this.addContextDependency(directory: string)`

Add the directory as a dependency for the loader results so that any changes to the files in the directory can be listened to.

## `this.addDependency(file: string)`

Add a file as a dependency on the loader results so that any changes to them can be listened to. For example, `sass-loader`, `less-loader` use this trick to recompile when the imported style files change.

## `this.dependency(file: string)`

Alias of `this.addDependency(file: string)`.

## `this.addMissingDependency(file: string)`

Add a non-existent file as a dependency on the loader results to make them listenable.

## `this.async()`

Tells Rspack that this loader will be called asynchronously. Returns `this.callback`.

## `this.cacheable(flag: boolean = true)`

By default, the processing results of the loader are marked as cacheable. Calling this method and passing `false` turns off the loader's ability to cache processing results.

## `this.callback(err: Error | null, content: string | Buffer, sourceMap?: SourceMap, meta?: any)`

A function that can be called synchronously or asynchronously in order to return multiple results. The expected arguments are:

1. The first parameter must be `Error` or `null`, which marks the current module as a compilation failure.
2. The second argument is a `string` or `Buffer`, which indicates the contents of the file after the module has been processed by the loader.
3. The third parameter is a source map that can be processed by the loader.
4. The fourth parameter is ignored by Rspack and can be anything (e.g. some metadata).

## `this.clearDependencies()`

Removes all dependencies of the loader result.

## `this.context`

The directory where the current module is located.

## `this.data`

A data object shared between the pitch and the normal phase.

## `this.emitError(err: Error)`

Emit an error. Unlike `throw` and `this.callback(err)` in the loader, it does not mark the current module as a compilation failure, it just adds an error to Rspack's Compilation and displays it on the command line at the end of this compilation.

## `this.emitWarning(warning: Error)`

Emit a warning.

## `this.emitFile(name: string, content: Buffer | string, sourceMap: SourceMap)`

Emit a file.

## `this.getOptions(schema)`

Extracts the given loader option, accepting an optional JSON schema as an argument.

## `this.getResolve(options: ResolveOptions): resolve`

Create a resolver like `this.resolve`.

## `this.resolve(context: string, request: string, callback: (err: Error | null, result: string) => void)`

Resolve a request.

- `context` must be the absolute path to a directory. This directory is used as the starting location for resolving.
- `request` is the request to be resolved.
- `callback` is a callback function that gives the resolved path.

## `this.mode`

The value of [`mode`](/config/mode) is read when webpack is run.

The possible values are: `'production'`, `'development'`, `'none'`

## `this.resource`

The path string of the current module. For example `'/abc/resource.js?query#hash'`.

## `this.resourcePath`

The path string of the current module, excluding the query and fragment parameters. For example `'/abc/resource.js?query#hash'` in `'/abc/resource.js'`.

## `this.resourceQuery`

The query parameter for the path string of the current module. For example `'?query'` in `'/abc/resource.js?query#hash'`.

## `this.resourceFragment`

The fragment parameter of the current module's path string. For example `'#hash'` in `'/abc/resource.js?query#hash'`.

## `this.rootContext`

The directory where the project is configured in config

## `this.sourceMap`

Whether a source map should be generated.

## `this.getLogger(name?: string)`

Get the logger of this compilation, through which messages can be logged.
