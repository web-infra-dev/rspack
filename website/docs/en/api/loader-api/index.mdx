# Compatibility Status

Rspack is committed to being compatible with the loaders within the webpack ecosystem. We ensure that Rspack is as compatible as possible with the webpack loader API, allowing more existing webpack loaders to be directly used in Rspack.

We have already made most of the webpack loader APIs compatible. You can visit [this page](https://github.com/orgs/web-infra-dev/projects/10) to learn about the current compatibility status of webpack loader APIs.
