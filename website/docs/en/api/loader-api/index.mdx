# Compatibility Status

Rspack loader is designed to reuse the webpack loader, it is compatible with most of the webpack loader API, the rest of the API is still being implemented, so most of the webpack loader can already run in Rspack.

You can visit [this page](https://github.com/orgs/web-infra-dev/projects/10) to learn about the current compatibility status of webpack loader APIs.
