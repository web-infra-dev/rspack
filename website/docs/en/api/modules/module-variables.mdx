# Module Variables

This section covers all **variables** available in code compiled with webpack. Modules will have access to certain data from the compilation process through `module` and other variables.

### module.hot (webpack-specific)

Indicates whether or not Hot Module Replacement is enabled and provides an interface to the process. See the [HMR API page](/api/hmr) for details.

### import.meta.webpackHot (webpack-specific)

An alias for `module.hot`, however `import.meta.webpackHot` can be used in strict ESM while `module.hot` can't.

### \_\_dirname (NodeJS)

Depending on the configuration option `node.__dirname`:

- `false`: Not defined
- `mock`: equal to `'/'`
- `true`: [node.js \_\_dirname](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_dirname)

If used inside an expression that is parsed by the Parser, the configuration option is treated as `true`.

### \_\_resourceQuery (webpack-specific)

The resource query of the current module. If the following `require` call was made, then the query string would be available in `file.js`.

```ts
require('file.js?test');
```

```ts title="file.js"
__resourceQuery === '?test';
```

### \_\_webpack_modules\_\_ (webpack-specific)

Access to the internal object of all modules.

### \_\_webpack_hash\_\_ (webpack-specific)

It provides access to the hash of the compilation.

### \_\_webpack_public_path\_\_ (webpack-specific)

Equals the configuration option's [`output.publicPath`](/config/output#outputpublicpath).

### \_\_webpack_chunkname\_\_ (webpack-specific)

<ApiMeta addedVersion="0.4.4" />

Access to name of current chunk.

### \_\_webpack_runtime_id\_\_ (webpack-specific)

<ApiMeta addedVersion="0.4.4" />

Access the runtime id of current entry.
