# Module Methods

This section covers all methods available in code compiled with Rspack. When using Rspack to bundle your application, you can pick from a variety of module syntax styles including ES6, CommonJS.

While Rspack supports multiple module syntaxes, we recommend following a single syntax for consistency and to avoid odd behaviors/bugs.

## ES6 (Recommended)

Rspack support ES6 module syntax natively, you can use static `import`, `export` and `import()` syntax.

### import

Statically `import` the `export`s of another module.

```js
import MyModule from './my-module.js';
import { NamedExport } from './other-module.js';
```

You can also `import` Data URI:

```js
import 'data:text/javascript;charset=utf-8;base64,Y29uc29sZS5sb2coJ2lubGluZSAxJyk7';
import {
  number,
  fn,
} from 'data:text/javascript;charset=utf-8;base64,ZXhwb3J0IGNvbnN0IG51bWJlciA9IDQyOwpleHBvcnQgY29uc3QgZm4gPSAoKSA9PiAiSGVsbG8gd29ybGQiOw==';
```

### export

Export anything as a `default` or named export.

```js
// Named exports
export var Count = 5;
export function Multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

// Default export
export default {
  // Some data...
};
```

### Dynamic import()

```ts
function(path: string): Promise
```

Dynamically load modules. Calls to `import()` are treated as split points, meaning the requested module and its children are split out into a separate chunk.

```js
if (module.hot) {
  import('lodash').then(_ => {
    // Do something with lodash (a.k.a '_')...
  });
}
```

:::warning
This feature relies on `Promise` internally. If you use import() with older browsers, remember to shim `Promise` using a polyfill such as [es6-promise](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise) or [promise-polyfill](https://github.com/taylorhakes/promise-polyfill).
:::

### Dynamic expressions in import()

It is not possible to use a fully dynamic import statement, such as `import(foo)`. Because `foo` could potentially be any path to any file in your system or project.

The `import()` must contain at least some information about where the module is located. Bundling can be limited to a specific directory or set of files so that when you are using a dynamic expression - every module that could potentially be requested on an `import()` call is included.
For example, `import(`./locale/${language}.json`)` will cause every `.json` file in the `./locale` directory to be bundled into the new chunk. At run time, when the variable `language` has been computed, any file like `english.json` or `german.json` will be available for consumption.

```js
// imagine we had a method to get language from cookies or other storage
const language = detectVisitorLanguage();
import(`./locale/${language}.json`).then(module => {
  // do something with the translations
});
```

### Magic Comments

Inline comments to make features work. By adding comments to the import, we can do things such as name our chunk or select different modes. For a full list of these magic comments see the code below followed by an explanation of what these comments do.

```js
import(
  /* webpackChunkName: "my-chunk-name" */
  /* webpackPrefetch: true */
  /* webpackPreload: true */
  'module'
);
```

`webpackChunkName`: A name for the new chunk.

`webpackPrefetch`: Tells the browser that the resource is probably needed for some navigation in the future (Available since 0.4.5).

`webpackPreload`: Tells the browser that the resource might be needed during the current navigation (Available since 0.4.5).

## CommonJS

Rspack is also support `CommonJS` syntax natively, you can use `require` and `module.exports` methods.

## Data URI Module

Rspack supports importing Data URI modules using the `import` and `require` syntax.

**import**

```js
import DataURI from 'data:text/javascript,export default 42';
```

**require**

```js
require('data:text/javascript,module.exports = 42');
```

In addition, Base64 encoded requests are also supported:

```js
const {
  number,
  fn,
} = require('data:text/javascript;charset=utf-8;base64,ZXhwb3J0IGNvbnN0IG51bWJlciA9IDQyOwpleHBvcnQgZnVuY3Rpb24gZm4oKSB7CiAgcmV0dXJuICJIZWxsbyB3b3JsZCI7Cn0=');
```

::: tip
The Data URI module can be used as a method to implement virtual modules, such as combining with a Loader to dynamically load custom modules at runtime.
:::

## Webpack

Aside from the module syntaxes described above, Rspack also support some webpack-specific methods.

#### require.context

```ts
require.context(
  (directory: String),
  (includeSubdirs: Boolean) /* optional, default true */,
  (filter: RegExp) /* optional, default /^\.\/.*$/, any file */,
  (mode: String) /* optional, 'sync' | 'eager' | 'weak' | 'lazy' | 'lazy-once', default 'sync' */
);
```

Specify a whole group of dependencies using a path to the `directory`, an option to `includeSubdirs`, a `filter` for more fine grained control of the modules included, and a mode to define the way how loading will work.

```js
const context = require.context('components', true, /\.html$/);
const componentA = context.resolve('componentA');
```

If mode is set to 'lazy', the underlying modules will be loaded asynchronously.

```js
const context = require.context('locales', true, /\.json$/, 'lazy');
context('localeA').then(locale => {
  // do something with locale
});
```
