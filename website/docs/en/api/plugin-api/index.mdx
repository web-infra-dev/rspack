# Compatibility Status

Rspack is committed to being compatible with the plugins within the webpack ecosystem. We ensure that Rspack is as compatible as possible with the webpack plugin API, allowing more existing webpack plugins to be directly used in Rspack.

We have already made most of the webpack plugin APIs compatible. You can visit [this page](https://github.com/orgs/web-infra-dev/projects/9) to learn about the current compatibility status of webpack plugin APIs.
