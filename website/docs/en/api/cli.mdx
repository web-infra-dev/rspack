# Command Line Interface (CLI)

@rspack/cli provides two common subcommands, serve and build, to simplify daily work. If you do not have @rspack/cli installed, please read the [Quick Start](/guide/quick-start) section first.

:::warning Compatible with webpack-cli
@rspack/cli is not going to be compatible with webpack-cli, so there will be many differences between the two.
:::

## Build

Run the `rspack build` command, which will generate the output files for production.

```sh
$ rspack build # Read the rspack.config.js configuration file by default
$ rspack build -c ./your.config.js
```

## Serve

Running the Rspack development server command will start a local development server that will listen for file changes and automatically refresh the browser.

```sh
$ rspack serve
$ rspack serve -c ./your.config.js
```

## Flags

By default Rspack provides some common command line arguments, you can see all of them with --help.
