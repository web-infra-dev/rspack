# Introduction

A variety of interfaces are available to customize the compilation process. Some features overlap between interfaces, e.g. a configuration option may be available via a CLI flag, while others exist only through a single interface. The following high-level information should get you started.

## CLI

The Command Line Interface (CLI) to configure and interact with your build. It is especially useful in the case of early prototyping and profiling. For the most part, the CLI is used to kick off the process using a configuration file and a few flags (e.g. `--env`).

## Modules

The Modules interface is used to define the supported module syntax and methods, see [Modules interface](/api/modules) for details.

## Hot Module Replacement API

The Hot Module Replacement (HMR) interface is used to implement hot module replacement, see [Hot Module Replacement Interface](/api/hmr) for details.

## Loader API

Loader is used to convert the source code of the module, please refer to [Loader API](/api/loader-api) for more details.

## Plugin API

Plugin allows users to intervene in the compilation process. Plugins can register callback functions on different lifecycles to modify the user's compilation process, see [Plugin API](/api/plugin-api) for more details.
