# Announcing Rspack v0.7

> May 28, 2024

Rspack v0.7 has been released!

This is the last minor release before the Rspack v1.0. After this, the Rspack team will focus on the development of v1.0 and aim to launch the Rspack v1.0 alpha version soon.

Notable changes in Rspack v0.7:

- [Support for Lazy Compilation](#support-for-lazy-compilation): Significantly improves the dev startup performance of large applications by compiling on demand.
- [Faster CSS Build](#faster-css-builds): Introducing a new css-module-lexer, which increases CSS bundling speed by 4 times.
- [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes): Removed some unstable APIs to make default behaviors more consistent with webpack.

## Support for Lazy Compilation

Rspack v0.7 now supports lazy compilation, which is very helpful for improving the build performance of multi-page applications (MPA) or large single-page applications (SPA).

### What is Lazy Compilation

Lazy Compilation is a good way to improve performance. It can compile code modules only when needed instead of compiling all modules at startup. This means developers can see their applications running faster when they launch a development server, because the relevant modules will only be compiled when specific functionality is accessed.

The easiest mental model would be:

Imagine some code that you may not use at the first run, for example, when you click a button, load another page, if you don't click that button at all when you develop other stuff, that page is useless, so we don't need to build it. We build it once we do execute the click.

We try to make entries and dynamic imports as split point, for example, consider:

`A -dyn import()-> B -dyn import()-> C`

When we compile A, we make B just an empty file, pretend user never write any code in it:

`A -dyn import()-> B'(empty content)`

Once we access B, which means we do need to build B, we fill B with its original content, pretend that user write content immediately

### Why need Lazy Compilation

Although Rspack itself has good performance, the overall build time can still be less than ideal when building applications with a large number of modules. This is because the modules in the application need to be compiled by various loaders, such as `postcss-loader`, `sass-loader`, `vue-loader`, etc., which introduce additional compilation overhead.

With lazy compilation enabled, Rspack will only compile the entrypoints and dynamic import modules that are requested. This can significantly reduce the number of modules that are compiled at development startup, improving startup time.

Take the Rspack official website as an example. The Rspack official website contains multiple pages. When Lazy Compilation is turned on, only the accessed entry and its dependent files will be built. This greatly improves the compilation speed and makes the startup time of the Rspack official website from 2s+ dropped to within 1s ⚡️.

### How to use

Now, you can enable the lazy compilation feature in Rspack through the [experiments.lazyCompilation](/config/experiments#experimentslazycompilation) configuration:

```file=rspack.config.js
module.exports = {
  experiments: {
    lazyCompilation: true,
  },
};
```

Please note that the current lazy compilation aligns with the webpack implementation, **and is still in the experimental stage**. We will continue to improve the usability of lazy compilation in different scenarios to achieve a more stable state. If you encounter any issues while using it, feel free to provide feedback to us via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack/issues).

## Faster CSS Builds

In v0.7, we have refactored the internal implementation of the [experiments.css](/config/experiments#experimentscss).

For CSS dependency analysis, we have developed [css-module-lexer](https://github.com/ahabhgk/css-module-lexer) using Rust. This is a high performance lexer for CSS Modules that can parse CSS or CSS Modules and return their dependency metadata.

With the integration of css-module-lexer, Rspack can now support more complex CSS Modules syntax, making its behaviour align with webpack's `css-loader`. For example, it can support the following CSS Modules syntax:

```css title="style.module.css"
:local(.parent):global(.child) > ul {
  color: red;
}
```

The CSS parsing process before and after the refactor is shown in the diagram below:

![rspack-css-lexer](https://assets.rspack.dev/rspack/assets/rspack-css-lexer.png)

`css-module-lexer` has also brought significant performance improvements to Rspack's `experiments.css`. In performance tests, the building performance of `bootstrap.css` has increased by about 4x.

- Before refactoring: ~84 ms (analyzing CSS dependencies ~71 ms)
- After refactoring: ~25 ms (analyzing CSS dependencies ~11 ms)

## Breaking Changes

Rspack will gradually remove all unstable APIs and configurations before version 1.0, and more configurations / APIs / default behaviors will be align with webpack.

### Deprecating unstable JavaScript APIs

Rspack early exposed some APIs that were intended for internal use only and were unstable, such as `compiler.compilation` and `compiler.builtinPlugins`. These APIs were not stable and could not be used in webpack.

In v0.7, we reorganized the currently exposed APIs and their interface definitions. If you have been using these APIs, you will need to make the necessary adjustments to align with the implementations consistent with webpack.

The following APIs are deprecated:

- `compiler.builtinPlugins`
- `compiler.compilation`
- `compiler.compilationParams`
- `compiler.getAsset(name)`
- `statsError.formatted`
- `statsWarning.formatted`
- ...

For details about the deprecated API, please refer to [rspack#6448](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack/pull/6448), [rspack#6505](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack/pull/6505).

### CSS @import rules must precede all other rules

In Rspack 0.7, we have partially refactored the internal implementation of [experiments.css](/config/experiments#experimentscss).

After refactoring, when `@import` is not at the top, you will get the following error. In this case, you need to manually adjust the `@import` rule to the top.

```bash
ERROR in ./src/main.css
  × Module parse failed:
  ╰─▶   × CSS parsing warning: Any '@import' rules must precede all other rules
         ╭─[4:1]
       4 │ };
       5 │
       6 │ @import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
         · ───────
       7 │
       8 │
         ╰────

  help:
        You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type.
```

### Remove builtins and experiments.rspackFuture.newTreeshaking

v0.7 has removed the `builtins.treeShaking` (oldTreeShaking) and `experiments.rspackFuture.newTreeshaking` (new tree shaking switch) configurations, taking the old tree shaking functionality completely offline.

### Remove resolve.browserField

This configuration is shorthand for `resolve.aliasFields = ["browser"]`, and since Rspack already supports `resolve.aliasFields`, this configuration is no longer necessary.

### Remove experiments.newSplitChunks

This configuration is used to enable the new splitChunks implementation, and since Rspack already uses the new splitChunks implementation by default, this configuration is no longer needed.

### Remove snapshot

This configuration is used to control the snapshot strategy when using cache. Under Rspack's current incremental rebuild architecture, cache no longer relies on snapshot, so this configuration is no longer needed.

### Remove exportsConvention for module type css

This configuration is used to control the naming convention of CSS module exports in experiments.css. It only has an effect on modules with the module type `css/module`, which have exports. For modules with the module type `css`, there are no exports, so this configuration is not needed.

### Upgrade SWC to 0.91.x

Upgraded the Rust crate `swc_core` to `0.91.x`. This will affect users of the SWC Wasm plugin.

## Migration Guide

### Upgrade the SWC plugins

In version v0.7, the Rust crate `swc_core` has been upgraded to `0.91.x`. Users of the swc wasm plugin need to ensure version consistency with `swc_core` being used, otherwise, it may lead to unforeseen issues.

For more details, please see this [document](https://swc.rs/docs/plugin/selecting-swc-core#091x) of swc。

### Replace resolve.browserField with resolve.aliasFields

If you previously configured `resolve.browserField`, you will need to replace it with `resolve.aliasFields`:

- `resolve.browserField = true` is replaced with `resolve.aliasFields = ["browser"]`
- `resolve.browserField = false` is replaced with `resolve.aliasFields = []`

### Remove generator.css.exportsConvention

If you previously configured `module.generator.css.exportsConvention` or `generator.exportsConvention` in `module.rule`, you only need to delete that configuration.
