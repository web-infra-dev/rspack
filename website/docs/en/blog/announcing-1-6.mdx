## New features

### Improved ESM output

The new [EsmLibraryPlugin](/plugins/rspack/esm-library-plugin) is now available as an experimental feature, providing better and more static output for library builds.

ESM library building has always been a weakness of Rspack. Previously, we implemented ESM output optimization based on [concatenateModules](/config/optimization#optimizationconcatenatemodules), but it still had some limitations.

- Each asynchronously loaded Chunk output exports the chunk id and module information required by the Rspack runtime, rather than the actual exports of the modules in the Chunk.
- Many scenarios would cause modules to fail concatenation, leading to unexpected errors in the output.

Therefore, we introduced the experimental EsmLibraryPlugin to completely solve the above problems. The EsmLibraryPlugin takes full control of Rspack's Chunk rendering and loading mechanism, no longer relying on Rspack's runtime to execute the entire output. It links modules in Chunks at compile time and can be used in combination with optimization features like SplitChunks.

```js title="rspack.config.mjs"
import { rspack } from '@rspack/core';

export default {
  plugins: [new rspack.experiments.EsmLibraryPlugin()],
  output: {
    chunkFormat: false, // disable default chunk format as EsmLibraryPlugin will handle how chunks are rendered and loaded
  },
  optimization: {
    runtimeChunk: true, // recommended to enable runtime chunk, otherwise consumers need to import runtime code from entry
    concatenateModules: false, // disable module concatenation as EsmLibraryPlugin has its own scope hoisting implementation
  },
};
```

The new EsmLibraryPlugin breaks away from the webpack runtime's Chunk Group parallel loading architecture, allowing each Chunk to be loaded and used independently. SplitChunks is still supported, so users can continue to use SplitChunks to split output according to their needs.

Experimental support for the preserveModules feature is provided, allowing the output structure to be preserved according to the source code structure.

```js title="rspack.config.mjs"
import path from 'path';

new rspack.experiments.EsmLibraryPlugin({
  preserveModules: path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
});
```

### Enhanced tree shaking

Rspack 1.6 improves tree shaking support for dynamic imports (`import()`). Previously, Rspack could only perform tree shaking on destructured assignments within dynamic imports, while other import patterns were not analyzed.

Now, Rspack introduces comprehensive static analysis for dynamic imports. It can recognize and handle various usage patterns, accurately removing unused exports and further reducing the final bundle size.

```js title="rspack.config.mjs"
// Rspack 1.5 â€“ Only supported destructured imports
const { value } = await import('./module');
console.log(value);

// Rspack 1.6 â€“ Now supports the following cases
const mod = await import('./module');
const { value } = mod;
console.log(value);

const mod = await import('./module');
console.log(mod.value);

import('./module').then(({ value }) => {
  console.log(value);
});

import('./module').then(mod => {
  const { value } = mod;
  console.log(value);
});

import('./module').then(mod => {
  console.log(mod.value);
});
```

### Support for import defer

Rspack now experimentally supports [defer import](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-defer-import-eval), which you can enable through [experiments.deferImport](/config/experiments#experimentsdeferimport). Currently, we only support the `import defer` syntax, and `import.defer()` will be implemented later.

```js title="rspack.config.mjs"
export default {
  experiments: {
    deferImport: true,
  },
};
```

### Optimized barrels by default

In Rspack v1.5, we introduced the experimental lazyBarrel optimization feature, specifically designed to improve the build performance of barrel files. After a period of production environment practice and user feedback collection, we confirmed that the lazyBarrel feature has reached a stable state, so it is enabled by default in Rspack v1.6.

:::info
What are Barrel Files? Barrel files are files that are primarily used to re-export content from other modules, typically used to simplify import paths and provide a unified API entry point.
:::

### Stabilized layers feature

In version 1.6.0, we deprecated the experimental switch for [experiments.layers](/config/experiments#experimentslayers), and you can now directly start using the [layer feature](/guide/features/layer#layer).

layer is a practical feature that allows you to categorize and manage modules. You can assign different layers to modules and then handle them differently based on the layer, such as downgrading modules to different targets according to different layers, or splitting modules from different layers into different output directories.

We have an [introduction article about the layer feature](/guide/features/layer#layer), where you can learn more about the layer feature.

### Preserve JSX syntax

Rspack now supports preserving JSX syntax in the output. Rspack only analyzes JSX without performing any transformations.

```js title="rspack.config.mjs"
export default {
  module: {
    parser: {
      javascript: {
        jsx: true, // Enable JSX parsing
      },
    },
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        use: {
          loader: 'builtin:swc-loader',
          options: {
            jsc: {
              parser: { jsx: true },
              transform: {
                // Preserve JSX syntax
                react: { runtime: 'preserve' },
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### Extract source map

Rspack now supports extracting existing source map data from files (from their `//# sourceMappingURL` comments) through [Rule.extractSourceMap](/config/module#ruleextractsourcemap). This feature is particularly useful for preserving source maps provided by third-party libraries, ensuring that debugging information remains accurate even when these libraries are bundled or transformed.

This feature was introduced as a built-in alternative to [source-map-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/source-map-loader), providing better performance and tighter integration with the build process.

```js title="rspack.config.mjs"
export default {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.m?js$/,
        extractSourceMap: true,
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

## Rstack progress

[Rstack](/guide/start/ecosystem#rstack) is a unified JavaScript toolchain centered around Rspack, featuring excellent performance and consistent architecture.

### Rsbuild 1.6

#### Forward browser logs

Rsbuild now automatically forwards error logs from the browser to the terminal, helping you conveniently view runtime errors during development. This also enables Coding Agents to obtain more complete context from terminal logs, allowing them to better analyze and locate errors.

<img
  src="https://assets.rspack.rs/rspack/assets/rspack-v1-6-error-forward.png"
  alt="rsbuild-error-forward"
  width="600"
/>

If you don't need this feature, you can disable it by setting [dev.browserLogs](https://rsbuild.rs/config/dev/browser-logs) to false:

```js title=rsbuild.config.ts
// rsbuild.config.ts
export default {
  dev: {
    browserLogs: false,
  },
};
```

#### Building ESM applications

Rsbuild now supports building ES Modules format output for Web applications, simply enable [output.module: true](https://rsbuild.rs/zh/config/output/module):

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  output: {
    module: true,
  },
};
```

Once enabled, Rsbuild will no longer generate IIFE format scripts by default, but will output standard ESM format and automatically set the generated `<script>` tags to `type="module"`.

#### Faster configuration loading

Since Node.js 22 already natively supports TypeScript, Rsbuild now defaults to using Node.js's native loader to parse configuration files; if loading fails, it will automatically fall back to [Jiti](https://github.com/unjs/jiti). When using Node.js 22 and above, this mechanism ensures that module resolution behavior remains consistent with Node.js native behavior while providing better loading performance.

You can also manually specify the loading method through the Rsbuild CLI's --config-loader option:

```bash
# Force use of native loading
rsbuild build --config-loader native

# Force use of jiti loading
rsbuild build --config-loader jiti
```

### Rspress v2 beta

#### New theme preview

Rspress V2's new theme has entered internal testing phase and has been synchronized to the V2 website!

The new theme has been comprehensively upgraded in design, bringing a better documentation reading experience. It also opens up more stable theme interfaces and CSS class names, achieving extremely high freedom in UI customization.

#### Sub-page switching

Rspress V2 adds the `<PageTabs />` component, which can create sub-tabs within the same page, splitting a single page into multiple sub-pages.

![rspress-page-tabs](https://assets.rspack.rs/rspack/assets/rspack-v1-6-page-tabs.png)

### Rslib 0.16

#### Faster type generation

Rslib now supports generating type declaration files based on [TSGO](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go), simply enable [dts.tsgo](https://rslib.rs/zh/config/lib/dts#dtstsgo). This can bring about 2.5 ~ 3 times improvement in type generation performance, with more significant benefits in large projects.

```ts title="rslib.config.ts"
export default {
  lib: [
    {
      dts: {
        tsgo: true,
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

#### Preserve JSX syntax

Rslib now supports preserving original JSX in build output, simply set runtime to [`'preserve'`](https://rsbuild.rs/zh/plugins/list/plugin-react#preserve). In this mode, JSX syntax will be preserved as-is without any transformation, making it convenient for subsequent processing by other bundling tools.

```ts title="rslib.config.ts"
import { pluginReact } from '@rsbuild/plugin-react';

export default {
  lib: [
    {
      bundle: false,
      format: 'esm',
    },
  ],
  plugins: [
    pluginReact({
      swcReactOptions: {
        runtime: 'preserve',
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

#### Enhanced CLI

Rslib supports [additional CLI options](https://rslib.rs/zh/guide/basic/cli#rslib-build) in the build command, which take precedence over configuration files.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rslib build --entry index.ts --minify --tsconfig tsconfig.build.json"
  }
}
```

You can also use Rslib without a configuration file, and the CLI will automatically use a default configuration containing only a single [lib](https://rslib.rs/zh/config/lib/) and complete the build based on command line parameters.

### Rstest 0.6

#### VS Code extension

The Rstest [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rstack.rstest) can easily discover, run, and debug Rstest tests, enabling developers to efficiently manage test cases and quickly view test results.

![rstest-vscode-extension](https://assets.rspack.rs/rspack/assets/rspack-v1-6-rstest-vscode-ext.gif)

#### Coverage support

Rstest supports using istanbul to collect code coverage and generate coverage reports.
