## New features

### Enhanced tree shaking

Rspack 1.6 improved tree shaking support for dynamic imports. In previous versions, Rspack could only perform tree shaking on destructured assignments within dynamic imports, while other import patterns were not analyzed.

Now, Rspack introduces comprehensive static analysis for dynamic imports. It can recognize and handle a wider range of usage patterns. This allows Rspack to precisely eliminate unused exports and further reduce the size of the final bundle.

```js
// Rspack 1.5 – Only supported destructured imports
const { value } = await import('./module');
console.log(value);

// Rspack 1.6 – Now supports the following cases
// Case 1
const mod = await import('./module');
const { value } = mod;
console.log(value);

// Case 2
const mod = await import('./module');
console.log(mod.value);

// Case 3
import('./module').then(({ value }) => {
  console.log(value);
});

// Case 4
import('./module').then((mod) => {
  const { value } = mod;
  console.log(value);
});

// Case 5
import('./module').then((mod) => {
  console.log(mod.value);
});
```

### Support for import defer

Rspack now supports the [import defer](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-defer-import-eval) syntax.

`import defer` is a new feature in JavaScript, which is also supported in [TypeScript 5.9](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-9-beta/#support-for-import-defer). It allows you to import a module without immediately executing the module and its dependencies, giving you better control over when code execution and side effects occur.

```js
import defer * as foo from './foo';
```

You can enable this feature through [experiments.deferImport](/config/experiments#experimentsdeferimport):

```js title="rspack.config.mjs"
export default {
  experiments: {
    deferImport: true,
  },
};
```

> Currently, Rspack only supports the `import defer` syntax. The function form `import.defer()` will be implemented in future versions.

### Improved ESM output

Optimizing ESM output has long been one of the key challenges faced by Rspack. Previously, we relied on [module concatenation](/config/optimization#optimizationconcatenatemodules) to optimize ESM outputs, but that approach had several limitations:

- **Impure output** – The generated files contained Rspack's runtime code.
- **Prone to errors** – Some modules could not be correctly concatenated, leading to unexpected runtime issues.
- **Limited code-splitting support** – Split bundles became complex and difficult to analyze or optimize statically.

To address these issues once and for all, we introduced an experimental plugin called [EsmLibraryPlugin](/plugins/rspack/esm-library-plugin), purpose-built for constructing clean and efficient ESM libraries:

- **Full control over the bundling process** – All modules are linked during compilation, eliminating reliance on Rspack's runtime.
- **Code-splitting support** – Code after splitting can be statically analyzed and is tree-shaking friendly.

The image below compares the code splitting output before and after using this plugin — the left side shows the previous output, while the right side shows the cleaner output produced by EsmLibraryPlugin:

![Rspack 1.6 ESM output diff](https://assets.rspack.rs/rspack/assets/rspack-v1-6-esm-diff.png)

The EsmLibraryPlugin is now largely complete and is being integrated into Rslib to provide an out-of-the-box experience. You can also enable it manually with the following configuration:

```js title="rspack.config.mjs"
import { rspack } from '@rspack/core';

export default {
  plugins: [new rspack.experiments.EsmLibraryPlugin()],
  optimization: {
    // Recommended to enable; otherwise, consumers must import runtime code from the entry.
    runtimeChunk: true,
  },
};
```

In addition, we've introduced an `preserveModules` option that preserves the original directory structure of your source files in the output:

```js title="rspack.config.mjs"
import path from 'node:path';

export default {
  plugins: [
    new rspack.experiments.EsmLibraryPlugin({
      preserveModules: path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, './src'),
    }),
  ],
};
```

### Optimized barrels by default

In Rspack 1.5, we introduced the experimental [lazyBarrel](/config/experiments#experimentslazybarrel) optimization feature, specifically designed to improve the build performance of barrel files. After a period of production environment practice and user feedback collection, we confirmed that the lazyBarrel feature has reached a stable state, so it is enabled by default in Rspack 1.6.

:::info
What are barrel files? Barrel files are files that are primarily used to re-export content from other modules, typically used to simplify import paths and provide a unified API entry point.
:::

### Stabilized layers feature

Layer is a feature for organizing modules into different layers, which can be useful in advanced scenarios such as React Server Components. By assigning different layers to modules, you can gain finer control over their build behavior, for example:

- Compiling modules in different layers for different target environments
- Outputting them to separate build directories

Starting from Rspack 1.6, the layer feature has become stable enough that the experimental flag [experiments.layers](/config/experiments#experimentslayers) has been deprecated. You can now use the layer feature directly without the experimental flag.

For more details and practical examples, check out our new [Layer guide](/guide/features/layer#layer).

### Preserve JSX syntax

Rspack now supports preserving JSX syntax in the build output. When this option is enabled, Rspack only parses JSX syntax without transforming it into JavaScript.

This feature is especially useful when building libraries that rely on JSX. For example, when using Rslib to build a component library, you can choose to keep the JSX code as-is in the output, allowing the consumer to handle the final JSX transformation during usage.

```js title="rspack.config.mjs"
export default {
  module: {
    parser: {
      javascript: {
        jsx: true, // Enable JSX parsing
      },
    },
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        use: {
          loader: 'builtin:swc-loader',
          options: {
            jsc: {
              parser: { jsx: true },
              transform: {
                // Preserve JSX syntax
                react: { runtime: 'preserve' },
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### Extract source map

Rspack now supports extracting existing source map data from files (from their `//# sourceMappingURL` comments) through [rules[].extractSourceMap](/config/module-rules#rulesextractsourcemap). This feature is particularly useful for preserving source maps provided by third-party libraries, ensuring that debugging information remains accurate even when these libraries are bundled or transformed.

This feature was introduced as a built-in alternative to [source-map-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/source-map-loader), providing better performance and tighter integration with the build process.

```js title="rspack.config.mjs"
export default {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.m?js$/,
        extractSourceMap: true,
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### Performance improvements

Rspack 1.6 introduces several performance optimizations. Compared with Rspack 1.5.0, you can expect the following improvements:

- CLI startup is about **50 ms faster**
- Building 10000 React components is **11% faster**
- Building multiple UI component libraries is **31% faster** (thanks to the newly enabled barrel-file optimization by default)

> Data source: [Rspack benchmark](https://github.com/rstackjs/build-tools-performance)

## Rstack progress

[Rstack](/guide/start/ecosystem#rstack) is a unified JavaScript toolchain centered around Rspack, featuring excellent performance and consistent architecture.

### Rsbuild 1.6

#### Forward browser logs

Rsbuild now automatically forwards error logs from the browser to the terminal, helping you conveniently view runtime errors during development. This also enables Coding Agents to obtain more complete context from terminal logs, allowing them to better analyze and locate errors.

![rsbuild-error-forward](https://assets.rspack.rs/rspack/assets/rspack-v1-6-error-forward.png)

If you don't need this feature, you can disable it by setting [dev.browserLogs](https://rsbuild.rs/config/dev/browser-logs) to false:

```js title=rsbuild.config.ts
export default {
  dev: {
    browserLogs: false,
  },
};
```

#### Building ESM applications

Rsbuild now supports building ES Modules format output for Web applications, simply enable [output.module: true](https://rsbuild.rs/config/output/module):

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  output: {
    module: true,
  },
};
```

Once enabled, Rsbuild will no longer generate IIFE format scripts by default, but will output standard ESM format and automatically set the generated `<script>` tags to `type="module"`.

#### Faster configuration loading

Since Node.js 22 already natively supports TypeScript, Rsbuild now defaults to using Node.js's native loader to parse configuration files; if loading fails, it will automatically fall back to [Jiti](https://github.com/unjs/jiti). When using Node.js 22 and above, this mechanism ensures that module resolution behavior remains consistent with Node.js native behavior while providing better loading performance.

You can also manually specify the loading method through the Rsbuild CLI's --config-loader option:

```bash
# Force use of native loading
rsbuild build --config-loader native

# Force use of jiti loading
rsbuild build --config-loader jiti
```

### Rspress v2 beta

#### New theme preview

Rspress's new theme has entered preview phase and is now live on the v2 website. 🎉

The new theme has been comprehensively upgraded in design, bringing a better documentation reading experience. It also exposes more theme APIs and CSS class names, making it easier for developers to customize the UI.

> 👉 Visit the [Rspress v2 website](https://v2.rspress.rs/) to try it out.

![rspress-v2-theme](https://assets.rspack.rs/rspack/assets/rspack-v1-6-rspress.gif)

#### Sub-page switching

Rspress v2 introduces the [PageTabs](https://v2.rspress.rs/ui/components/page-tabs) component, allowing you to create multiple sub-tabs within a single page. This helps naturally split long content into well-structured subpages.

![Rspress sub-page switching](https://assets.rspack.rs/rspack/assets/rspack-v1-6-page-tabs.png)

### Rslib 0.16

#### Faster type generation

Rslib now supports generating type declaration files based on [typescript-go](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go). By simply enabling [dts.tsgo](https://rslib.rs/config/lib/dts#dtstsgo), you can boost type checking and declaration generation performance by around **300%**, with even greater benefits in large projects.

```ts title="rslib.config.ts"
export default {
  lib: [
    {
      dts: { tsgo: true },
    },
  ],
};
```

#### Preserve JSX syntax

Rslib now supports preserving original JSX in build output, simply set runtime to [`'preserve'`](https://rsbuild.rs/plugins/list/plugin-react#preserve). In this mode, JSX syntax will be preserved as-is without any transformation, making it convenient for subsequent processing by other bundling tools.

```ts title="rslib.config.ts"
import { pluginReact } from '@rsbuild/plugin-react';

export default {
  lib: [
    {
      bundle: false,
      format: 'esm',
    },
  ],
  plugins: [
    pluginReact({
      swcReactOptions: {
        runtime: 'preserve',
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

#### More CLI options

Rslib supports additional [CLI options](https://rslib.rs/guide/basic/cli#rslib-build) in the build command, which take precedence over configuration files.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rslib build --entry index.ts --minify --tsconfig tsconfig.build.json"
  }
}
```

This also allows you to use Rslib without a configuration file, and the CLI will automatically use a default configuration containing only a single [lib](https://rslib.rs/config/lib/) and complete the build based on command line parameters.

### Rstest 0.6

#### VS Code extension

The [Rstest VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rstack.rstest) is now available. It allows you to discover, run, and debug tests directly within the editor, helping you efficiently manage test cases and quickly review test results.

![rstest-vscode-extension](https://assets.rspack.rs/rspack/assets/rspack-v1-6-rstest-vscode-ext.gif)

#### Coverage support

Rstest now supports collecting code coverage using Istanbul and generating detailed coverage reports. For more information, see [Rstest – Coverage](https://rstest.rs/config/test/coverage).

![rstest-coverage](https://assets.rspack.rs/rspack/assets/rspack-v1-6-rstest-cov.png)

### Rsdoctor 1.3

#### Rsdoctor GitHub Actions

Rsdoctor now provides a [GitHub bundle diff action](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rsdoctor-action), which automatically detects and compares bundle size changes during the CI phase. This helps teams identify and prevent bundle size regressions early.

![Rsdoctor GitHub Actions](https://assets.rspack.rs/rspack/assets/rspack-v1-6-bundle-diff.png)

#### All-in-one JSON report

Rsdoctor now supports exporting a [all-in-one JSON report file](https://rsdoctor.rs/config/options/output#mode-brief) in Brief mode. This file can be easily stored, shared, or used for further data analysis. In addition, we’ve introduced a new [Playground page](https://rsdoctor.rs/guide/start/playground), where developers can upload the JSON report to reopen and visually explore the analysis results.

## Ecosystem

### next-rspack

In Next.js 16, next-rspack has integrated Rspack's [custom Rust binding solution](https://github.com/rstackjs/rspack-binding-template), delivering significant performance gains:

- 24% faster build performance
- 10% faster dev performance

In this customized Rspack Rust binding, the `externals` logic from Next.js has been moved to the Rust side, greatly reducing communication overhead between JavaScript and Rust.

| Tool                 | Build time (no cache) | Dev time (no cache) |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Rspack (next@16.0.0) | 3.8s                  | 1.7s                |
| Rspack (next@15.4.0) | 5.0s                  | 1.9s                |
| webpack              | 14.0s                 | 7.8s                |

The benchmark is based on the [chakra-ui-docs](https://github.com/SyMind/chakra-ui-docs/tree/next-rspack) repository. Full performance data is available here: [PERF.md](https://github.com/SyMind/chakra-ui-docs/blob/next-rspack/PERF.md).

## Upgrade guide

### Upgrade SWC plugins

If your project uses SWC Wasm plugins (such as `@swc/plugin-emotion`), you need to upgrade the plugins to a version compatible with `swc_core@46`, otherwise it may cause build errors due to version incompatibility.

> For more details, see [FAQ - SWC plugin version mismatch](/errors/swc-plugin-version).

### Remove `experiments.layer`

`experiments.layer` option has been deprecated, you can remove it directly:

```diff title="rspack.config.mjs"
export default {
-  experiments: {
-   layer: true,
-  },
};
```
