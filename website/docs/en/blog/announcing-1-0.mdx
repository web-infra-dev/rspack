**Rspack 1.0 version released!**

Rspack is a next-generation JavaScript bundler written in Rust, compatible with the webpack API and ecosystem, and is 10 times faster than webpack.

18 months ago, we open-sourced Rspack 0.1 and received a lot of feedback and contributions from the community. During this time, 170 contributors have joined in the development of Rspack, submitting over 5000 pull requests and over 2000 issues, helping Rspack to rapidly release over 80 versions. And Rspack's weekly downloads on npm have exceeded 100,000 ðŸŽ‰.

Today Rspack has finally reached a new milestone - 1.0. This means that Rspack is production ready, covers most of Webpack's APIs and features, and is now prepared to support more users.

## New Features

Since the release of 0.1, Rspack has introduced many important features and optimizations, including:

### Improved Performance

As a Rust-based bundler, performance has always been a core metric for Rspack. Since the release of Rspack 0.1, we have made numerous performance improvements, optimizing its performance for different scenarios, and supporting key features such as [lazy compilation](https://rspack.dev/config/experiments#experimentslazycompilation) to ensure better performance in large projects.

Here is a comparison of build performance between Rspack 0.1 and Rspack 1.0 from the [benchmark](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/performance-compare). As shown, Rspack has significantly improved build performance while adding many new features:

Note that the current architecture and implementation of Rspack still have a lot of room for optimization. After the release of 1.0, we plan to further improve the performance by several folds to better support large-scale application development.

### Better Production Optimization

Rspack has always had a focus on the bundle size of production builds. Since the release of 0.1, Rspack has gradually aligned its optimization capabilities with webpack, implementing features such as [split chunks](https://rspack.dev/plugins/webpack/split-chunks-plugin#splitchunksplugin), [tree shaking](https://rspack.dev/guide/optimization/tree-shaking), [scope hoisting](https://rspack.dev/config/optimization#optimizationconcatenatemodules) and [mangle exports](https://rspack.dev/config/optimization#optimizationmangleexports).

When a project migrates from webpack to Rspack, these features ensure that the bundle size remains the same as webpack while improving DX. In some scenarios, the output size of Rspack has even slightly outperformed webpack.

For example, in a real-world medium web application, the bundle size of Rspack 1.0 was optimized from 6600KB to 5900KB compared to Rspack 0.1, which is equivalent to webpack. In the future, Rspack will continue to explore more advanced solutions for optimizing bundle size.

### Support for Module Federation 2.0

[Module Federation](https://module-federation.io/), as the most advanced micro-frontend architecture, has been widely adopted within the frontend ecosystem. The Rspack team has been working with the Module Federation team to develop Module Federation 2.0. The new version provides features such as dynamic TS type hints, Chrome devtools, runtime plugins, preloading. These features make Module Federation more suitable for use as a micro-frontend architecture in large-scale web applications.

Rspack also provides compatibility and support for Module Federation 1.0, making it easier for webpack projects to migrate.

### Stable API and New Website

In 1.0, we have improved the stability of the configuration, JavaScript API, and plugin API. This ensures that higher level tools and frameworks can more easily integrate with Rspack. We have also improved the documentation of each configuration and API on the official website.

Rspack 1.0 also includes a brand new [homepage](https://rspack.dev/). Many thanks to designer Emily Jackson and team member Zack Jackson for their efforts in making this happen.

## Why Rspack

Over the past two years, the community has seen the birth of several Rust-based bundlers, all of which have demonstrated remarkable performance. Rspack does not only provides first-class performance. It also leads the community in terms of flexibility and compatibility.

The current goals of Rspack are:

- To help existing webpack projects progressively migrate to a high performance bundler, so that build performance is no longer a bottleneck for fast iterations.
- Rspack is not just suitable for environments like Web and Node.js that we are familiar with; its goal is to cover all environments where JavaScript runs. This means that Rspack can easily support Deno, Electron, cross-platform applications, MiniApps, and any other JavaScript runtime.
- We found that balancing "flexibility" and "out-of-the-box" in a single tool was a challenging task. Therefore, after open-sourcing Rspack, we developed a set of Rstack toolchains, including projects such as [Rsbuild](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rsbuild), [Rspress](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspress), [Rsdoctor](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rsdoctor), and [Rslib](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rslib), each targeting different use cases. For example, to reduce the complexity and high barriers to configuring Rspack, we provide Rsbuild for an out-of-the-box development experience.
