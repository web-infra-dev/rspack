## New features

### Circular dependency detection

Rspack 1.3 introduces a built-in plugin [CircularDependencyRspackPlugin](/plugins/rspack/circular-dependency-rspack-plugin) to detect circular dependencies between runtime modules.

This plugin is implemented in Rust and deeply integrated with Rspack's module graph, avoiding expensive data copying and serialization overhead. It detects all circular dependencies by performing a single traversal of the module graph for each entry point, rather than checking each module independently, resulting in lower performance overhead.

```js title="rspack.config.mjs"
import { rspack } from '@rspack/core';

export default {
  plugins: [new rspack.CircularDependencyRspackPlugin()],
};
```

### Build HTTP imports

In previous versions, you could import HTTP/HTTPS resources by using [externalsPresets.web](/config/externals#externalspresetsweb) or [externalsPresets.webAsync](/config/externals#externalspresetswebasync) options, which simply externals the these resources and let the browser (or other platform) to fetch them at runtime.

```js
import pMap from 'https://esm.sh/p-map';
```

And the new [experiments.buildHttp](/config/experiments#experimentsbuildhttp) option provides a new way to import HTTP/HTTPS resources, not fetch the resources at runtime, but download them to the local cache at build time and then bundle them into your output.

```js title="rspack.config.mjs"
export default {
  experiments: {
    buildHttp: {
      allowedUris: ['https://esm.sh/'],
      // ...
    },
  },
};
```

> See [the docs](/config/experiments#experimentsbuildhttp) for more details.

### Lazy compilation improvements

In previous versions, when [lazy compilation](/guide/features/lazy-compilation) was enabled, Rspack would start a separate server to handle lazy compilation-related requests. This led to several issues, such as the need for two servers during development, and the lazy compilation server not being able to share proxy and CORS configurations with the default dev server.

Rspack 1.3 provides new Express-style middleware for integrating lazy compilation that addresses these issues.

- If you are using `@rspack/cli` or Rsbuild, you can upgrade to the new middleware by simply updating the dependency version.
- If you are using a custom development server, you will need to integrate this middleware to support lazy compilation.

Here's an example of how to use the lazy compilation middleware:

```js
import { rspack } from '@rspack/core';
import config from './rspack.config.mjs';
import DevServer from 'webpack-dev-server';

const compiler = rspack(config);
const middleware = rspack.experiments.lazyCompilationMiddleware(
  compiler,
  config.experiments.lazyCompilation,
);

const server = new DevServer(
  {
    setupMiddlewares(other) {
      return [middleware, ...other];
    },
  },
  compiler,
);
```

### AMD supports

Rspack now allows you to enable AMD module support by using the [amd](/config/other-options#amd) option.

Notably, Rspack differs from webpack in that the parsing of AMD modules is disabled by default (webpack enables it by default). This feature is only for compatibility with certain legacy AMD npm dependencies. We recommend prioritizing ES Module dependencies for better Rspack optimization and to boost ES Module adoption.

Add the `amd` option to enable support:

```js title="rspack.config.mjs"
export default {
  amd: {
    // ...
  },
};
```

## Performance improvements

### Code splitting 25% faster

In Rspack 1.2, we introduced the [experiments.parallelCodeSplitting](/config/experiments#experimentsparallelcodesplitting) option to enable the new code splitting algorithm.

Starting from Rspack 1.3, this option is enabled by default, resulting in a **25%** performance boost for code splitting.

### Bundle size optimization

Rspack 1.3 introduces full support for the [output.environment](/config/output#outputenvironment) option, which allows you to specify which ECMAScript features can be used in the runtime code generated by Rspack, and to generate shorter and more modern runtime code.

By default, Rspack parses the [target](/config/target) option and automatically sets the values of the `output.environment` sub-options based on `browserslist` to determine which ECMAScript features are supported by the target environment, thus outputting the optimized code.

For example, if Rspack detects that the target environment supports arrow functions, it sets `output.environment.arrowFunction` to `true` and using arrow function syntax in the generated code.

```diff
// before
- __webpack_require__.d = function(exports, definition) {

// after
+ __webpack_require__.d = (exports, definition) => {
```

By utilizing modern JavaScript features supported by the target environment, Rspack can output smaller runtime code. In our performance testing on a real large-scale project, this optimization reduced the bundle size by approximately 500KB (before gzip compression).

### Memory improvements

Rspack now defaults to using [mimalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc) v3 on macOS. This mitigates some memory consumption issue on macOS during rebuilding. According to some community and internal projects, this would lift the RSS for rebuilding, based on the size of each project, varying from **10% to 85%**。

Rspack 1.3 also implemented an internal mechanism to clean the outdated cache: `maxGenerations`. This controls how many compilations would cache survive if it's not being used by the compiler. Rspack sets the default to `1`. This means that the cache will be purged if it's not being used in the next compilation.

### Rsdoctor 1.0

After a year of development and testing, we are proud to introduce [Rsdoctor 1.0](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rsdoctor) — a build analyzer tailored for the Rspack ecosystem and fully compatible with the webpack ecosystem.

Rsdoctor is committed to being a one-stop, intelligent build analyzer that makes the build process transparent, predictable, and optimizable through visualization and smart analysis, helping development teams precisely identify bottlenecks, optimize performance, and improve engineering quality.

Rsdoctor 1.0 introduces significant enhancements:

- A completely redesigned UI that delivers more intuitive and efficient information visualization.
- Rewrote data processing logic using Rust, achieving 20%+ improvement in analysis speed.
- New module search capabilities for analyzing dependencies and module sizes.

### Rsbuild 1.3

Rsbuild 1.3 has been released alongside Rspack 1.3, notable features including:

- Support importing compiled CSS files as strings by using the [?inline](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/basic/css-usage#inline) query parameter:

```js
import inlineCss from './style.css?inline';

console.log(inlineCss); // Output the compiled CSS file content
```

- Support importing raw CSS files and static assets as strings by using the [?raw](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/basic/css-usage#raw) query parameter:

```js
import rawSvg from './logo.svg?raw';
import rawCss from './style.css?raw';

console.log(rawSvg); // Output the raw SVG file content
console.log(rawCss); // Output the raw CSS file content
```

### Rslib 0.6

Rslib 0.6 brings the following notable updates:

- **Improved CJS output**: Rslib's CJS output can now be statically analyzed, allowing Node.js ESM modules to use named imports to reference exports from CJS output.
- **Type error optimization**: When type errors occur, Rslib now prints the full context and code frame to the terminal, making it easier to fix type issues.

This release also adds support for YAML and TOML. See [Rslib 0.6](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rslib/releases/tag/v0.6.0) for more details.

### Rspress and Rstest

We are also working on:

- **Rspress 2.0**: A fully upgraded static site generator with richer features and better performance.
- **Rstest**: A testing framework powered by Rspack. It delivers comprehensive, first-class support for the Rspack ecosystem, enabling seamless integration into existing Rspack-based projects.

More information will be released soon, stay tuned 🌟

## Ecosystem

### Rspeedy for Lynx

[Lynx](https://lynxjs.org/) is a family of technologies empowering developers to use their existing web skills to create truly native UIs for both mobile and web from a single codebase. Lynx was originally developed by an engineering team of ByteDance, which continues to drive its development.

## Upgrade guide

### Module types changed

The module types exported by Rspack have been refined with more accurate type definitions, which helps to align with webpack. Currently supported module subtypes include:

- NormalModule
- ContextModule
- ExternalModule
- ConcatenatedModule

You can now identify a module's specific type in two ways:

```ts
// Method 1: Instance type checking
module instanceof NormalModule;

// Method 2: Constructor signature detection
module.constructor.name === 'NormalModule';
```

The new type definitions may cause type errors in existing JavaScript API code, such as:

```ts
module.resource; // TypeScript Error: Property 'resource' does not exist on type 'Module'
```

To access the `resource` property, you now need to assert the module type using one of the following methods:

```ts
// Solution 1: `in` operator type guard
if ('resource' in module) {
  console.log(module.resource);
}

// Solution 2: Instance type assertion
if (module instanceof NormalModule) {
  module.resource;
}
```

### Upgrade SWC plugins

In Rspack 1.3, the Rust crate `swc_core` has been upgraded to v16. Users of the SWC Wasm plugin need to ensure version consistency with `swc_core` being used, otherwise, it may lead to unforeseen issues.

For more details, see [FAQ - SWC plugin version unmatched](/errors/swc-plugin-version).
