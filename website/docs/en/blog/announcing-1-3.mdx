## New features

### Circular dependency detection

Rspack 1.3 introduces a built-in plugin [CircularDependencyRspackPlugin](/plugins/rspack/circular-dependency-rspack-plugin) to detect circular dependencies between runtime modules.

This plugin is implemented in Rust and deeply integrated with Rspack's module graph, avoiding expensive data copying and serialization overhead. It detects all circular dependencies by performing a single traversal of the module graph for each entry point, rather than checking each module independently, resulting in lower performance overhead.

```js title="rspack.config.mjs"
import { rspack } from '@rspack/core';

export default {
  plugins: [new rspack.CircularDependencyRspackPlugin()],
};
```

### Build HTTP imports

In previous versions, you could import HTTP/HTTPS resources by using [externalsPresets.web](/config/externals#externalspresetsweb) or [externalsPresets.webAsync](/config/externals#externalspresetswebasync) options, which simply externals the these resources and let the browser (or other platform) to fetch them at runtime.

```js
import pMap from 'https://esm.sh/p-map';
```

And the new [experiments.buildHttp](/config/experiments#experimentsbuildhttp) option provides a new way to import HTTP/HTTPS resources, not fetch the resources at runtime, but download them to the local cache at build time and then bundle them into your output.

```js title="rspack.config.mjs"
export default {
  experiments: {
    buildHttp: true, // Enable HTTP/HTTPS module imports
  },
};
```

> See [the docs](/config/experiments#experimentsbuildhttp) for more details.

### Lazy compilation middleware

Lazy compilation used to have a standalone server to handle special requests from lazy compiled modules. It won't share proxy config with normal user's dev server, now the lazy compilation server side ability is provided through express style middleware. If you're using @rspack/cli you should feel no difference.

If you have your own dev server, you can make your server supports lazy compilation feature simply by adding this middleware to your server.

```js
import { experiments, rspack } from '@rspack/core';
import config from './rspack.config.mjs';
import DevServer from 'webpack-dev-server';

const compiler = rspack(config);

const middleware = experiments.lazyCompilationMiddleware(
  compiler,
  config.experiments.lazyCompilation,
);

const server = new DevServer(compiler, {
  port: 3000,
  setupMiddlewares(other) {
    return [middleware, ...other];
  },
});

server.start();
```

### AMD supports

Rspack now allows you to enable AMD module support by using the [amd](/config/other-options#amd) option.

Notably, Rspack differs from webpack in that the parsing of AMD modules is disabled by default (webpack enables it by default). This feature is only for compatibility with certain legacy AMD npm dependencies. We recommend prioritizing ES Module dependencies for better Rspack optimization and to boost ES Module adoption.

Add the `amd` option to enable support:

```js title="rspack.config.mjs"
export default {
  amd: {
    // ...
  },
};
```

## Performance improvements

### Code splitting 25% faster

In Rspack 1.2, we introduced the [experiments.parallelCodeSplitting](/config/experiments#experimentsparallelcodesplitting) option to enable the new code splitting algorithm.

Starting from Rspack 1.3, this option is enabled by default, resulting in a **25%** performance boost for code splitting.

### Bundle size optimization

Rspack 1.3 introduces full support for the [output.environment](/config/output#outputenvironment) option, which allows you to specify which ECMAScript features can be used in the runtime code generated by Rspack, and to generate shorter and more modern runtime code.

By default, Rspack parses the [target](/config/target) option and automatically sets the values of the `output.environment` sub-options based on `browserslist` to determine which ECMAScript features are supported by the target environment, thus outputting the optimized code.

For example, if Rspack detects that the target environment supports arrow functions, it sets `output.environment.arrowFunction` to `true` and using arrow function syntax in the generated code.

```diff
// before
- __webpack_require__.d = function(exports, definition) {

// after
+ __webpack_require__.d = (exports, definition) => {
```

By utilizing modern JavaScript features supported by the target environment, Rspack can output smaller runtime code. In our performance testing on a real large-scale project, this optimization reduced the bundle size by approximately 500KB (before gzip compression).

### Memory improvements

Rspack now defaults to using [mimalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc) v3 on macOS. This mitigates some memory consumption issue on macOS during rebuilding. According to some community and internal projects, this would lift the RSS for rebuilding, based on the size of each project, varying from **10% to 85%**。

Rspack 1.3 also implemented an internal mechanism to clean the outdated cache: `maxGenerations`. This controls how many compilations would cache survive if it's not being used by the compiler. Rspack sets the default to `1`. This means that the cache will be purged if it's not being used in the next compilation.

## Ecosystem

### Rsdoctor 1.0

After a year of development and testing, we are proud to introduce [Rsdoctor 1.0](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rsdoctor) — a build analyzer tailored for the Rspack ecosystem and fully compatible with the webpack ecosystem.

Rsdoctor is committed to being a one-stop, intelligent build analyzer that makes the build process transparent, predictable, and optimizable through visualization and smart analysis, helping development teams precisely identify bottlenecks, optimize performance, and improve engineering quality.

Rsdoctor 1.0 introduces significant enhancements:

- A completely redesigned UI that delivers more intuitive and efficient information visualization.
- Rewrote data processing logic using Rust, achieving 20%+ improvement in analysis speed.
- New module search capabilities for analyzing dependencies and module sizes.

### Rsbuild 1.3

Rsbuild 1.3 has been released alongside Rspack 1.3, notable features including:

- Support importing compiled CSS files as strings by using the [?inline](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/basic/css-usage#inline) query parameter:

```js
import inlineCss from './style.css?inline';

console.log(inlineCss); // Output the compiled CSS file content
```

- Support importing raw CSS files and static assets as strings by using the [?raw](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/basic/css-usage#raw) query parameter:

```js
import rawSvg from './logo.svg?raw';
import rawCss from './style.css?raw';

console.log(rawSvg); // Output the raw SVG file content
console.log(rawCss); // Output the raw CSS file content
```

### Rspeedy for Lynx

[Lynx](https://lynxjs.org/) is a family of technologies empowering developers to use their existing web skills to create truly native UIs for both mobile and web from a single codebase. Lynx was originally developed by an engineering team of ByteDance, which continues to drive its development.

Lynx has built a modern toolchain called [Rspeedy](https://lynxjs.org/zh/rspeedy/) based on Rspack, Rsbuild, and Rsdoctor to enable fast builds. Lynx also features a speedy, versatile rendering engine and performance-driven dual-threaded UI programming.

## Upgrade guide

### Module subtypes changed

To improve webpack API compatibility, Rspack modules are now structured as specific subtypes. Currently supported module subtypes include:

- NormalModule
- ContextModule
- ExternalModule
- ConcatenatedModule

You can now identify a module's specific type in two ways:

```ts
// Method 1: Instance type checking
module instanceof NormalModule;

// Method 2: Constructor signature detection
module.constructor.name === 'NormalModule';
```

The new type definitions may cause type errors in existing JavaScript API code, such as:

```ts
module.resource; // TypeScript Error: Property 'resource' does not exist on type 'Module'
```

To access the resource property, you now need to assert the module type using one of the following methods:

```ts
// Solution 1: `in` operator type guard
if ('resource' in module) {
  console.log(module.resource);
}

// Solution 2: Instance type assertion
if (module instanceof NormalModule) {
  module.resource;
}
```

### Upgrade SWC plugins

In Rspack 1.3, the Rust crate `swc_core` has been upgraded to v16. Users of the SWC Wasm plugin need to ensure version consistency with `swc_core` being used, otherwise, it may lead to unforeseen issues.

For more details, see [FAQ - SWC plugin version unmatched](/errors/swc-plugin-version).
