# Announcing Rspack v1.0 Alpha

> June 29, 2024

![](https://assets.rspack.dev/rspack/rspack-banner-v1-0-alpha.png)

Rspack 1.0 Alpha is now available on npm!

Before releasing Rspack 1.0 stable version, we will test for 1~2 months to improve the API stability and reliability of v1.0 and to verify its impact on downstream projects.

The stable release of Rspack 1.0 is expected to be available in early August this year.

## Lean Core

To ensure the long term stability of Rspack v1, we have removed some non-core features that were built into the Rspack core. This allows the core to be lean and focused on providing common bundler features.

In v0.x, Rspack core has built-in SWC plugins to support Emotion, Styled Components, and Relay. This is because in the early days Rspack did not support the use of SWC Wasm plugins and could only integrate them into the core.

Currently, Rspack supports the use of SWC plugins via [experimental.plugins](/guide/features/builtin-swc-loader#jscexperimentalplugins) in `builtin:swc-loader`. So we have removed the built-in plugins from the Rspack core, including:

- [@swc/plugin-emotion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swc/plugin-emotion)
- [@swc/plugin-relay](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swc/plugin-relay)
- [@swc/plugin-styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swc/plugin-styled-components)

### Migration Example

Take @swc/plugin-styled-components as an example. In v1.0, you can use it as follows.

- Installation:

```bash
npm i @swc/plugin-styled-components -D
```

- Configuration:

```diff
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        loader: "builtin:swc-loader",
        options: {
-         rspackExperiments: {
-           styledComponents: {},
-         },
          jsc: {
+           experimental: {
+             plugins: [["@swc/plugin-styled-components", {}]],
+           },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

## Bundling CSS

Rspack 1.0 aligns with the webpack [experiment.css](/config/experiments#experimentscss) default value, making it easier to migrate from webpack to Rspack.

In the webpack ecosystem, there are three common approaches to bundling CSS files:

1. Use [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) and [mini-css-extract-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin) to generate standalone CSS files.
2. Use [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) and [style-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader) to inject CSS through `<style>` tags.
3. Use [experiment.css](/config/experiments#experimentscss), an experimental feature introduced in webpack 5 that provides native CSS support.

In version 0.x, Rspack enabled `experiment.css` by default, which would conflict with css-loader. Users had to manually disable `experiment.css` to use the other two methods.

Starting with Rspack 1.0, the default value of `experiment.css` changes to `false`, in line with webpack, allowing users to use any of the above approaches.

You can add the following configuration to continue using `experiment.css`:

```js title="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  experiments: {
    css: true,
  },
};
```

## Try it

To install the alpha version of Rspack and Rspack CLI:

```bash
# npm
npm add -D --save-exact @rspack/core@alpha @rspack/cli@alpha

# yarn
yarn add -D --save-exact @rspack/core@alpha @rspack/cli@alpha

# pnpm
pnpm add -D --save-exact @rspack/core@alpha @rspack/cli@alpha
```

During the Rspack alpha testing, new versions will still introduce some breaking changes, which we will highlight in the changelog. Please read the changelog to understand the differences before upgrading.
