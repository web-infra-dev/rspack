# Plugins

- **Type:**

```ts
type Falsy = false | '' | 0 | null | undefined;

type Plugin =
  | RspackPluginInstance
  | RspackPluginFunction
  | WebpackPluginInstance
  | WebpackPluginFunction
  | Falsy;

type Plugins = Plugin[];
```

- **Default:** `[]`

The `plugins` option is used to register a set of Rspack or webpack plugins to customize the build process.

Please refer to [Plugins page](/guide/features/plugin) for more information on using plugins in Rspack.

## Built-in plugins

Rspack comes with a variety built-in plugins available under `rspack.PluginName`.

For example, [`DefinePlugin`](/plugins/webpack/define-plugin) allows you to replaces variables in your code with other values or expressions at compile time. You can access it via `rspack.DefinePlugin` and create a plugin instance with `new`:

```js title=rspack.config.js
const { rspack } = require('@rspack/core');

module.exports = {
  //...
  plugins: [
    new rspack.DefinePlugin({
      // pass plugin options
    }),
  ],
};
```

## webpack plugins

Rspack strives to maintain compatibility with the webpack plugin ecosystem to leverage the excellent features that have been accumulated and validated by the community. Please refer to the [Plugin Compatibility List](/guide/compatibility/plugin) to access a list of webpack plugins that have passed our compatibility tests:

```js title=rspack.config.js
const { rspack } = require('@rspack/core');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  //...
  plugins: [new HtmlWebpackPlugin()],
};
```

## Disable plugins

Rspack ignores `false`、`''`、`0`、`null` 和 `undefined` values in the `plugins` array, which allows you to easily disable a plugin.

For example, enable [HotModuleReplacementPlugin](/plugins/webpack/hot-module-replacement-plugin) only in the development environment:

```js title=rspack.config.js
const { rspack } = require('@rspack/core');
const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';

module.exports = {
  plugins: [isDev && new rspack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin()],
};
```
