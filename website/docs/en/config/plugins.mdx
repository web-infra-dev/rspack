# Plugins

The `plugins` option is used to customize the Rspack build process in a variety of ways. Rspack comes with a variety built-in plugins available under `rspack.[plugin-name]`. See [Plugins page](/plugins/index) for a list of plugins and documentation but note that there are a lot more out in the community.

- **Type:** `Array<RspackPluginInstance | RspackPluginFunction | RspackBuiltinPlugin>`
- **Default:** `[]`

An array of webpack plugins. For example, [`DefinePlugin`](/plugins/webpack/define-plugin) allows you to create global constants which can be configured at compile time. This can be useful for allowing different behavior between development builds and release builds.

**rspack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  plugins: [
    new rspack.DefinePlugin({
      // Definitions...
    }),
  ],
};
```

Rspack strives to maintain compatibility with the webpack plugin ecosystem to leverage the excellent features that have been accumulated and validated by the community. Please refer to the [Plugin Compatibility List](/guide/compatibility/plugin) to access a list of webpack plugins that have passed our compatibility tests:

**rspack.config.js**

```js
const rspack = require('@rspack/core');
const ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin = require('fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  //...
  plugins: [new ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin()],
};
```
