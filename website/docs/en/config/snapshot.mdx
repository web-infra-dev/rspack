# Snapshot

Used to decide how the file system snapshots are created and invalidated.

- **Type:**

```ts
type Snapshot = {
  module?: {
    hash?: boolean;
    timestamp?: boolean;
  };
  resolve?: {
    hash?: boolean;
    timestamp?: boolean;
  };
};
```

### snapshot.resolve

- **Type:** `object = {hash?: boolean, timestamp?: boolean}`

- **Default:** `{ hash: false, timestamp: true }`

Snapshots for resolving of requests. When both hash and timestamp are false, the snapshot will be valid forever.

- hash: Compare content hashes to determine invalidation (more expensive than timestamp, but changes less often).
- timestamp: Compare timestamps to determine invalidation.

### snapshot.module

- **Type:** `object = {hash?: boolean, timestamp?: boolean}`

- **Default:** `{ hash: false, timestamp: true }`

Snapshots for building modules. When both hash and timestamp are false, the snapshot will be valid forever.

- hash: Compare content hashes to determine invalidation (more expensive than timestamp, but changes less often).
- timestamp: Compare timestamps to determine invalidation.

## Usage

You can set the snapshot directly in `rspack.config.js`:

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  snapshot: {
    resolve: {
      hash: true,
    },
  },
};
```
