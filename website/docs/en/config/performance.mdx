# Performance

These options allows you to control how Rspack notifies you of assets and entry points that exceed a specific file limit.

## performance

<PropertyType type="false | object" />

Configure how performance hints are shown. For example if you have an asset that is over 250kb, Rspack will emit a warning notifying you of this.

### performance.assetFilter

<PropertyType type="(assetFilename: string) => boolean" />

This property allows Rspack to control what files are used to calculate performance hints.

### performance.hints

<PropertyType
  type="false | 'error' | 'warning'"
  defaultValueList={[
    { defaultValue: 'warning', mode: 'production' },
    { defaultValue: 'false', mode: 'development' },
  ]}
/>

Turns hints on/off. In addition, tells Rspack to throw either an error or a warning when hints are found.

### performance.maxAssetSize

<PropertyType type="number" defaultValueList={[{ defaultValue: '250000' }]} />

An asset is any emitted file from Rspack. This option controls when Rspack emits a performance hint based on individual asset size in bytes.

### performance.maxEntrypointSize

<PropertyType type="number" defaultValueList={[{ defaultValue: '250000' }]} />

An entry point represents all assets that would be utilized during initial load time for a specific entry. This option controls when Rspack should emit performance hints based on the maximum entry point size in bytes.
