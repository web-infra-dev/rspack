# Deprecated options

This page lists configuration options that have been deprecated in Rspack.

These options are kept for backward compatibility only and should not be used in new projects.

## builtin:swc-loader options

### rspackExperiments.collectTypeScriptInfo

<ApiMeta deprecatedVersion="1.7.0" />

Used to collect information from TypeScript's AST for consumption by subsequent Rspack processes.

:::warning
This configuration has been deprecated. Use top-level [`collectTypeScriptInfo`](/guide/features/builtin-swc-loader#collecttypescriptinfo) instead.

```diff
{
  loader: 'builtin:swc-loader',
  options: {
-   rspackExperiments: {
-     collectTypeScriptInfo: {
-       exportedEnum: true,
-     },
-   },
+   collectTypeScriptInfo: {
+     exportedEnum: true,
+   },
  },
}
```

## experiments.parallelCodeSplitting

<ApiMeta deprecatedVersion="1.6.2" />

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `false`

Enabling this configuration will activate a new multi-threaded code splitting algorithm. If your project includes many dynamic imports and doesn't have cyclic chunks, this can greatly reduce the time spent on the code splitting process.

```js title="rspack.config.mjs"
export default {
  experiments: {
    parallelCodeSplitting: true,
  },
  optimization: {
    removeAvailableModules: true,
  },
};
```

:::warning
This option is deprecated, it has a huge performance regression in some edge cases where the chunk graph has lots of cycles. We'll improve the performance of build_chunk_graph in the future instead.
:::

:::warning
When `parallelCodeSplitting` is enabled, ensure that 'optimization.removeAvailableModules' is also enabled (this has been enabled by default since version 1.3.0).

This maintains consistency with the previous code splitting algorithm, which enforced `removeAvailableModules` internally and ignored the `optimization.removeAvailableModules` configuration.
:::

## rules[].loaders

An array to pass the loader package name and its options.

:::warning
This option has been deprecated. Use [rules[].use](/config/module-rules#rulesuse) instead.
:::

## experiments.typeReexportsPresence

<ApiMeta deprecatedVersion="1.7.0" />

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `false`

Used to enable error tolerance for type re-exports.

:::warning
This configuration has been deprecated and is no longer required. Type re-exports presence checking is now controlled by [`module.parser.javascript.typeReexportsPresence`](/config/module#moduleparserjavascripttypereexportspresence) and [`builtin:swc-loader collectTypeScriptInfo.typeExports`](/guide/features/builtin-swc-loader#collecttypescriptinfotypeexports).

Please refer to [type reexports presence example](https://github.com/rstackjs/rstack-examples/tree/main/rspack/type-reexports-presence) for more details.
