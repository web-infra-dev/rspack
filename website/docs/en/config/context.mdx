# Context

<PropertyType
  type="string"
  defaultValueList={[{ defaultValue: 'process.cwd()' }]}
/>

The `context` configuration is used to set the base directory for Rspack builds.

`context` is an absolute path that is used as the base path for relative paths in Rspack configurations such as [entry](config/entry) and [output](config/output).

By default, Rspack uses the current working directory of the Node.js process as the base directory. In most cases, it is recommended to set a base directory manually, rather than relying on the current working directory of Node.js.

## Example

For example, you can use `__dirname` as the base directory:

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  context: __dirname,
  entry: {
    main: './src/index.js',
  },
};
```

In the above example, the `main` entry will be resolved based on the `path.join(__dirname, './src/index.js')` path.
