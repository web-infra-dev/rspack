# Cache

Rspack will cache snapshots and intermediate products during the build process and use them in the next build to improve the speed of the build.

:::info Cache Type
Rspack currently only supports memory cache, persistent cache is under planning, for more details refer to [Persistent Cache Support](/misc/planning/roadmap#persistent-cache-support).
:::

This configuration currently only supports setting whether to enable caching.

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** [production mode](config/mode#production) is `false`, [development mode](config/mode#development) is `true`

## Usage

You can disable the cache directly in `rspack.config.js`:

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  cache: false,
};
```
