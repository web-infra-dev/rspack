		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			A continuous line.<br /><br />

			This is nearly the same
			as [page:LineSegments]; the only difference is that it is rendered using
			[link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/drawElements gl.LINE_STRIP]
			instead of [link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/drawElements gl.LINES]

		</p>


		<h2>Example</h2>

		<code>var material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({
			color: 0x0000ff
		});

		var geometry = new THREE.Geometry();
		geometry.vertices.push(
			new THREE.Vector3( -10, 0, 0 ),
			new THREE.Vector3( 0, 10, 0 ),
			new THREE.Vector3( 10, 0, 0 )
		);

		var line = new THREE.Line( geometry, material );
		scene.add( line );
		</code>


		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>[name]( [param:Geometry geometry], [param:Material material] )</h3>

		<p>
		[page:Geometry geometry] — vertices representing the line segment(s). Default is a new [page:BufferGeometry].<br />
		[page:Material material] — material for the line. Default is a new [page:LineBasicMaterial] with random color.<br />
		</p>

		<p>If no material is supplied, a randomized line material will be created and assigned to the object.</p>


		<h2>Properties</h2>
		<p>See the base [page:Object3D] class for common properties.</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isLine]</h3>
		<p>
			Used to check whether this or derived classes are lines. Default is *true*.<br /><br />

			You should not change this, as it used internally for optimisation.
		</p>


		<h3>[property:Geometry geometry]</h3>
		<p>Vertices representing the line segment(s).</p>

		<h3>[property:Material material]</h3>
		<p>Material for the line.</p>


		<h2>Methods</h2>
		<p>See the base [page:Object3D] class for common methods.</p>

		<h3>[method:Line computeLineDistances]()</h3>
		<p>
		Computes an array of distance values which are necessary for [page:LineDashedMaterial]. For each vertex in the geometry, the method calculates the cumulative length from the current point to the very beginning of the line.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:null raycast]( [param:Raycaster raycaster], [param:Array intersects] )</h3>
		<p>
		Get intersections between a casted [page:Ray] and this Line.
		[page:Raycaster.intersectObject] will call this method.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:Line clone]()</h3>
		<p>
		Returns a clone of this Line object and its descendants.
		</p>
