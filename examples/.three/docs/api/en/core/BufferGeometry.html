		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p>
		An efficient representation of mesh, line, or point geometry. Includes vertex positions, face
		indices, normals, colors, UVs, and custom attributes within buffers, reducing the cost of
		passing all this data to the GPU.
		</p>
		<p>
		To read and edit data in BufferGeometry attributes, see [page:BufferAttribute] documentation.
		</p>
		<p>
		For a less efficient but easier-to-use representation of geometry, see [page:Geometry].
		</p>

		<h2>Example</h2>
		<code>
		var geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
		// create a simple square shape. We duplicate the top left and bottom right
		// vertices because each vertex needs to appear once per triangle.
		var vertices = new Float32Array( [
			-1.0, -1.0,  1.0,
			 1.0, -1.0,  1.0,
			 1.0,  1.0,  1.0,

			 1.0,  1.0,  1.0,
			-1.0,  1.0,  1.0,
			-1.0, -1.0,  1.0
		] );

		// itemSize = 3 because there are 3 values (components) per vertex
		geometry.addAttribute( 'position', new THREE.BufferAttribute( vertices, 3 ) );
		var material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0xff0000 } );
		var mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );

		<h2>Constructor</h2>


		<h3>[name]()</h3>
		<div>
		This creates a new [name]. It also sets several properties to a default value.
		</div>


		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<h3>[property:Object attributes]</h3>
		<p>
		This hashmap has as id the name of the attribute to be set and as value the [page:BufferAttribute buffer] to set it to.
		Rather than accessing this property directly, use [page:.addAttribute] and [page:.getAttribute] to access attributes of this geometry.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Box3 boundingBox]</h3>
		<p>
			Bounding box for the bufferGeometry, which can be calculated with
			[page:.computeBoundingBox](). Default is *null*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Sphere boundingSphere]</h3>
		<p>
			Bounding sphere for the bufferGeometry, which can be calculated with
			[page:.computeBoundingSphere](). Default is *null*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Object drawRange]</h3>
		<p>
			Determines the part of the geometry to render. This should not
			be set directly, instead use [page:.setDrawRange]. Default is
			<code>
				{ start: 0, count: Infinity }
			</code>
			For non-indexed BufferGeometry, count is the number of vertices to render.
			For indexed BufferGeometry, count is the number of indices to render.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Array groups]</h3>
		<p>
			Split the geometry into groups, each of which will be rendered in a separate WebGL draw call.
			This allows an array of materials to be used with the bufferGeometry.<br /><br />

			Each group is an object of the form:
			<code>{ start: Integer, count: Integer, materialIndex: Integer }</code>
			where start specifies the first element in this draw call â€“ the first vertex for non-indexed geometry,
			otherwise the first triangle index. Count specifies how many vertices (or indices) are included, and
			materialIndex specifies the material array index to use.<br /><br />

			Use [page:.addGroup] to add groups, rather than modifying this array directly.
		</p>


		<!-- Note: groups used to be called drawCalls

		<h3>[property:Array drawcalls]</h3>
		<p>
		For geometries that use indexed triangles, this Array can be used to split the object
		into multiple WebGL draw calls. Each draw call will draw some subset of the vertices
		in this geometry using the configured [page:Material shader]. This may be necessary if,
		for instance, you have more than 65535 vertices in your object.
		</p> -->


		<h3>[property:Integer id]</h3>
		<p>Unique number for this bufferGeometry instance.</p>

		<h3>[property:BufferAttribute index]</h3>
		<p>
			Allows for vertices to be re-used across multiple triangles; this is called using "indexed triangles" and
			works much the same as it does in [page:Geometry]: each triangle is associated with the indices of three vertices.
			This attribute therefore stores the index of each vertex for each triangular face.

			If this attribute is not set, the [page:WebGLRenderer renderer] assumes that each three contiguous
			positions represent a single triangle.

			Default is *null*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isBufferGeometry]</h3>
		<p>
			Used to check whether this or derived classes are BufferGeometries. Default is *true*.<br /><br />

			You should not change this, as it used internally for optimisation.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Object morphAttributes]</h3>
		<p>
			Hashmap of [page:BufferAttribute]s holding details of the geometry's [page:Geometry.morphTargets morphTargets].
		</p>

		<h3>[property:String name]</h3>
		<p>
		Optional name for this bufferGeometry instance. Default is an empty string.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Object userData]</h3>
		<p>
		An object that can be used to store custom data about the BufferGeometry. It should not hold
		references to functions as these will not be cloned.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:String uuid]</h3>
		<p>
		[link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier UUID] of this object instance.
		This gets automatically assigned and shouldn't be edited.
		</p>

		<h2>Methods</h2>

		<h3>[page:EventDispatcher EventDispatcher] methods are available on this class.</h3>

		<h3>[method:BufferGeometry addAttribute]( [param:String name], [param:BufferAttribute attribute] )</h3>
		<p>
