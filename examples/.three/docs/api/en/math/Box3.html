		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			Represents a box or cube in 3D space. The main purpose of this is to represent
			the world-axis-aligned bounding boxes for objects. 
		</p>

		
		<h2>Example</h2>

		<code>
		// Creating the object whose bounding box we want to compute
		var sphereObject = new THREE.Mesh( 
			new THREE.SphereGeometry(), 
			new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( 0xff0000 ) 
		);
		// Creating the actual bounding box with Box3
		sphereObject.geometry.computeBoundingBox();
		var box = sphereObject.geometry.boundingBox.clone();

		// ...
		
		// In the animation loop, to keep the bounding box updated after move/rotate/scale operations
		sphereObject.updateMatrixWorld( true );
		box.copy( sphereObject.geometry.boundingBox ).applyMatrix4( sphereObject.matrixWorld );
		</code>
