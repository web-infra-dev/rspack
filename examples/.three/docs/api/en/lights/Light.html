		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			Abstract base class for lights - all other light types inherit the properties and methods
			described here.
		</p>


		<h2>Constructor</h2>


		<h3>[name]( [param:Integer color], [param:float intensity] )</h3>
		<p>
		[page:Integer color] - (optional) hexadecimal color of the light. Default is 0xffffff (white).<br />
		[page:Float intensity] - (optional) numeric value of the light's strength/intensity. Default is 1.<br /><br />

		Creates a new [name]. Note that this is not intended to be called directly (use one of derived classes instead).
		</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>
		<p>
			See the base [page:Object3D Object3D] class for common properties.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Color color]</h3>
		<p>
			Color of the light. Defaults to a new [page:Color] set to white, if not passed in the constructor.<br />
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float intensity]</h3>
		<p>
			The light's intensity, or strength.<br />
			In [page:WebGLRenderer.physicallyCorrectLights physically correct] mode, the product of
			[page:.color color] * intensity is interpreted as luminous intensity measured in candela.<br />
			Default - *1.0*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isLight]</h3>
		<p>
			Used to check whether this or derived classes are lights. Default is *true*.<br /><br />

			You should not change this, as it used internally for optimisation.
		</p>


		<h2>Methods</h2>
		<p>
			See the base [page:Object3D Object3D] class for common methods.
		</p>


		<h3>[method:Light copy]( [param:Light source] )</h3>
		<p>
		Copies the value of [page:.color color] and [page:.intensity intensity] from the
		[page:Light source] light into this one.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:Object toJSON]( [param:object meta] )</h3>
		<p>
		meta -- object containing metadata such as materials, textures for objects.<br />
		Convert the light to three.js [link:https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/JSON-Object-Scene-format-4 JSON Object/Scene format].
