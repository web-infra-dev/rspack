# Three.js Blender Export

> **NOTICE:** The Blender exporter for the Three.js JSON format has been removed, to focus on better support for other workflows. For recommended alternatives, see [Loading 3D Models](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/introduction/Loading-3D-models). The Three.js Object/Scene JSON format is still fully supported for use with [Object3D.toJSON](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/core/Object3D.toJSON), the [Editor](https://threejs.org/editor/), [THREE.ObjectLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/loaders/ObjectLoader) and [converters](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/utils/converters).
