		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			This light gets emitted from a single point in one direction, along a cone that increases in size
			the further from the light it gets. <br /><br />

			This light can cast shadows - see the [page:SpotLightShadow] page for details.

		<h2>Code Example</h2>
		<code>
		// white spotlight shining from the side, casting a shadow

		var spotLight = new THREE.SpotLight( 0xffffff );
		spotLight.position.set( 100, 1000, 100 );

		spotLight.castShadow = true;

		spotLight.shadow.mapSize.width = 1024;
		spotLight.shadow.mapSize.height = 1024;

		spotLight.shadow.camera.near = 500;
		spotLight.shadow.camera.far = 4000;
		spotLight.shadow.camera.fov = 30;

		scene.add( spotLight );
		</code>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>


		<h3>[name]( [param:Integer color], [param:Float intensity], [param:Float distance], [param:Radians angle], [param:Float penumbra], [param:Float decay] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Integer color] - (optional) hexadecimal color of the light. Default is 0xffffff (white).<br />
			[page:Float intensity] - (optional) numeric value of the light's strength/intensity. Default is 1.<br /><br />
			[page:Float distance] - Maximum range of the light. Default is 0 (no limit).<br />
			[page:Radians angle] - Maximum angle of light dispersion from its direction whose upper
			bound is Math.PI/2.<br />
			[page:Float penumbra] - Percent of the spotlight cone that is attenuated due to penumbra.
			Takes values between zero and 1. Default is zero.<br />
			[page:Float decay] - The amount the light dims along the distance of the light.<br /><br />

			Creates a new [name].
		</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>

		See the base [page:Light Light] class for common properties.

		<h3>[property:Float angle]</h3>
		<p>
			Maximum extent of the spotlight, in radians, from its direction. Should be no more than
			*Math.PI/2*. The default is *Math.PI/3*.
		</p>


		<h3>[property:Boolean castShadow]</h3>
		<p>
			If set to *true* light will cast dynamic shadows. *Warning*: This is expensive and
			requires tweaking to get shadows looking right. See the [page:SpotLightShadow] for details.
			The default is *false*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float decay]</h3>
		<p>
			The amount the light dims along the distance of the light.<br />
			In [page:WebGLRenderer.physicallyCorrectLights physically correct] mode, decay = 2 leads to
			physically realistic light falloff. The default is *1*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float distance]</h3>
		<p>
			<em>Default mode</em> — When distance is zero, light does not attenuate. When distance is
			non-zero, light will attenuate linearly from maximum intensity at the light's position down to
			zero at this distance from the light.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>[page:WebGLRenderer.physicallyCorrectLights Physically correct] mode</em> — When distance
			is zero, light will attenuate according to inverse-square law to infinite distance. When
			distance is non-zero, light will attenuate according to inverse-square law until near the
			distance cutoff, where it will then attenuate quickly and smoothly to 0. Inherently, cutoffs
			are not physically correct.
		</p>
		<p>
			Default is *0.0*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isSpotLight]</h3>
		<p>
			Used to check whether this or derived classes are spot lights. Default is *true*.<br /><br />

			You should not change this, as it used internally for optimisation.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float penumbra]</h3>
		<p>
			Percent of the spotlight cone that is attenuated due to penumbra. Takes values between
			zero and 1. The default is *0.0*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Vector3 position]</h3>
		<p>
			This is set equal to [page:Object3D.DefaultUp] (0, 1, 0), so that the light shines from the top down.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float power]</h3>
		<p>
			The light's power.<br />
			In [page:WebGLRenderer.physicallyCorrectLights physically correct] mode, the luminous
			power of the light measured in lumens. Default is *4Math.PI*. <br /><br />

			This is directly related to the [page:.intensity intensity] in the ratio
			<code>
				power = intensity * &pi;
			</code>
			and changing this will also change the intensity.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:SpotLightShadow shadow]</h3>
		<p>
			A [page:SpotLightShadow] used to calculate shadows for this light.
		</p>


		<h3>[property:Object3D target]</h3>
		<p>
			The Spotlight points from its [page:.position position] to target.position. The default
			position of the target is *(0, 0, 0)*.<br />

			*Note*: For the target's position to be changed to anything other than the default,
			it must be added to the [page:Scene scene] using
			<code>
				scene.add( light.target );
			</code>

			This is so that the target's [page:Object3D.matrixWorld matrixWorld] gets automatically
			updated each frame.<br /><br />

			It is also possible to set the target to be another object in the scene (anything with a
			[page:Object3D.position position] property), like so:
			<code>
var targetObject = new THREE.Object3D();
scene.add(targetObject);

light.target = targetObject;
			</code>
			The spotlight will now track the target object.
		</p>


		<h2>Methods</h2>

		See the base [page:Light Light] class for common methods.

		<h3>[method:SpotLight copy]( [param:SpotLight source] )</h3>
		<p>
		Copies value of all the properties from the [page:SpotLight source] to this
		SpotLight.
