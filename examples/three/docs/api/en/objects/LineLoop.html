		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			A continuous line that connects back to the start.<br /><br />

			This is nearly the same	as [page:Line]; the only difference is that it is rendered using
			[link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/drawElements gl.LINE_LOOP]
			instead of [link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/drawElements gl.LINE_STRIP],
			which draws a straight line to the next vertex, and connects the last vertex back to the first.
		</p>


		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>[name]( [param:Geometry geometry], [param:Material material] )</h3>

		<p>
		[page:Geometry geometry] — List of vertices representing points on the line loop.<br />
		[page:Material material] — Material for the line. Default is [page:LineBasicMaterial LineBasicMaterial].
		</p>

		<p>If no material is supplied, a randomized line material will be created and assigned to the object.</p>


		<h2>Properties</h2>
		<p>See the base [page:Line] class for common properties.</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isLineLoop]</h3>
		<p>
			Used to check whether this or derived classes are line loops. Default is *true*.<br /><br />

			You should not change this, as it used internally for optimisation.
		</p>
