		<h1>Draw Mode Constants</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			These are valid values for [page:Mesh.drawMode], and control how the list of vertices is interpeted once sent to the GPU.<br /><br />

			Note that these only work when [page:Mesh.geometry] is a [page:BufferGeometry]. Changing this
			when [page:Mesh.geometry] is a [page:Geometry] will have no effect.<br /><br />



		</p>

		<h2>Draw Modes</h2>

		<code>
			THREE.TrianglesDrawMode
		</code>
		<p>
			This is the default, and results in every three consecutive vertices (v0, v1, v2), (v2, v3, v5), ...
			being interpreted as a separate triangle. <br />
			If the number of vertices is not a multiple of 3, excess vertices are ignored.
		</p>

		<code>
			THREE.TriangleStripDrawMode
		</code>
		<p>
			This will result in a series of triangles connected in a strip, given by (v0, v1, v2), (v2, v1, v3), (v2, v3, v4), ...
			so that every subsequent triangle shares two vertices with the previous triangle.
		</p>

		<code>
			THREE.TriangleFanDrawMode
		</code>
		<p>
			This will result in a series of triangles each sharing the first vertex (like a fan),
			given by (v0, v1, v2), (v0, v2, v3), (v0, v3, v4), ... <br /><br />

			<em>Note:</em> As of [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX#DirectX_10 DirectX10], this mode is not supported. As Chrome and Firefox
			render WebGL using [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANGLE_(software) ANGLE] on Windows,
			internally this mode will be converted to a supported mode, which will likely lead to lowered
			performance on those browsers.
		</p>


		<h2>Usage</h2>

		<code>
		var geometry = new THREE.Geometry();

		geometry.vertices.push(
			new THREE.Vector3( -10,  10, 0 ),
			new THREE.Vector3( -10, -10, 0 ),
			new THREE.Vector3(  10, -10, 0 ),
			...
		);
		geometry.faces.push( new THREE.Face3( 0, 1, 2 ), ... );

		var material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0xffff00 } );

		var mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
		mesh.drawMode = THREE.TrianglesDrawMode; //default

		scene.add( mesh );
		</code>
