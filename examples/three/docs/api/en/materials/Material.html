		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
		Abstract base class for materials.<br /><br />

		Materials describe the appearance of [page:Object objects].
		They are defined in a (mostly) renderer-independent way, so you don't have to
		rewrite materials if you decide to use a different renderer.<br /><br />

		The following properties and methods are inherited by all other material types
		(although they may have different defaults).
		</p>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>


		<h3>[name]()</h3>
		<p>This creates a generic material.</p>


		<h2>Properties</h2>

		The material will not be renderered if the opacity is lower than this value.
		Default is *0*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer blendDst]</h3>
		<p>
		Blending destination. Default is [page:CustomBlendingEquation OneMinusSrcAlphaFactor].
		See the destination factors [page:CustomBlendingEquation constants] for all possible values.<br />
		The material's [page:Constant blending] must be set to [page:Materials CustomBlending] for this to have any effect.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer blendDstAlpha]</h3>
		<p>The transparency of the [page:.blendDst]. Default is *null*.</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer blendEquation]</h3>
		<p>
		Blending equation to use when applying blending. Default is [page:CustomBlendingEquation AddEquation].
		See the blending equation [page:CustomBlendingEquation constants] for all possible values.<br />
		The material's [page:Constant blending] must be set to [page:Materials CustomBlending] for this to have any effect.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer blendEquationAlpha]</h3>
		<p>The tranparency of the [page:.blendEquation]. Default is *null*.</p>

		<h3>[property:Blending blending]</h3>
		<p>
		Which blending to use when displaying objects with this material. <br />
		This must be set to [page:Materials CustomBlending] to use custom [page:Constant blendSrc], [page:Constant blendDst] or [page:Constant blendEquation].<br />
		See the blending mode [page:Materials constants] for all possible values. Default is [page:Materials NormalBlending].
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer blendSrc]</h3>
		<p>
		Blending source. Default is [page:CustomBlendingEquation SrcAlphaFactor].
		See the source factors [page:CustomBlendingEquation constants] for all possible values.<br />
		The material's [page:Constant blending] must be set to [page:Materials CustomBlending] for this to have any effect.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer blendSrcAlpha]</h3>
		<p>The tranparency of the [page:.blendSrc]. Default is *null*.</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean clipIntersection]</h3>
		<p>
		Changes the behavior of clipping planes so that only their intersection is clipped, rather than their union.
		Default is *false*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Array clippingPlanes]</h3>
		<p>
		User-defined clipping planes specified as THREE.Plane objects in world space.
		These planes apply to the objects this material is attached to.
		Points in space whose signed distance to the plane is negative are clipped (not rendered).
		This requires [page:WebGLRenderer.localClippingEnabled] to be *true*.
		See the [example:webgl_clipping_intersection WebGL / clipping /intersection] example.
		Default is *null*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean clipShadows]</h3>
		<p>
		Defines whether to clip shadows according to the clipping planes specified on this material. Default is *false*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean colorWrite]</h3>
		<p>
		Whether to render the material's color.
		This can be used in conjunction with a mesh's [page:Integer renderOrder] property to create invisible objects that occlude other objects. Default is *true*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Object defines]</h3>
		<p>
		Custom defines to be injected into the shader. These are passed in form of an object literal, with key/value pairs. { MY_CUSTOM_DEFINE: '' , PI2: Math.PI * 2 }. The pairs are defined in both vertex and fragment shaders.  Default is *undefined*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer depthFunc]</h3>

		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean depthWrite]</h3>
		<p>
		Whether rendering this material has any effect on the depth buffer. Default is *true*.<br /><br />

		When drawing 2D overlays it can be useful to disable the depth writing in order to layer several things together without creating z-index artifacts.
		</p>

		<p>
		Define whether the material is rendered with flat shading. Default is false.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean fog]</h3>
		<p>Whether the material is affected by fog. Default is *true*.</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer id]</h3>
		<p>Unique number for this material instance.</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isMaterial]</h3>
		<p>
			Used to check whether this or derived classes are materials. Default is *true*.<br /><br />

			You should not change this, as it used internally for optimisation.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean lights]</h3>
		<p>Whether the material is affected by lights. Default is *true*.</p>

		<h3>[property:String name]</h3>
		<p>Optional name of the object (doesn't need to be unique). Default is an empty string.</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean needsUpdate]</h3>
		<p>
		Specifies that the material needs to be recompiled.<br />
		This property is automatically set to *true* when instancing a new material.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float opacity]</h3>
		<p>
		Float in the range of *0.0* - *1.0* indicating how transparent the material is.
		A value of *0.0* indicates fully transparent, *1.0* is fully opaque.<br />
		If the material's [page:Boolean transparent] property is not set to *true*, the material will remain
		fully opaque and this value will only affect its color. <br />
		Default is *1.0*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean polygonOffset]</h3>
		<p>
		Whether to use polygon offset. Default is *false*. This corresponds to the *GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL* WebGL feature.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer polygonOffsetFactor]</h3>
		<p>Sets the polygon offset factor. Default is *0*.</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer polygonOffsetUnits]</h3>

		<p>
		Whether to apply dithering to the color to remove the appearance of banding.
		Default is *false*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer shadowSide]</h3>
		<p>
		Defines which side of faces cast shadows.
		When set, can be [page:Materials THREE.FrontSide], [page:Materials THREE.BackSide], or [page:Materials THREE.DoubleSide]. Default is *null*. <br />
		If *null*, the side casting shadows is determined as follows: <br />

		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>[page:Material.side]</th>
					<th>Side casting shadows</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>

				<tr>
					<td>THREE.FrontSide</td>
					<td>back side</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>THREE.BackSide</td>
					<td>front side</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>THREE.DoubleSide</td>
					<td>both sides</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>


		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer side]</h3>
		<p>
		Defines which side of faces will be rendered - front, back or both.
		Default is [page:Materials THREE.FrontSide].
		Other options are [page:Materials THREE.BackSide] and [page:Materials THREE.DoubleSide].
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean toneMapped]</h3>
		<p>
		Defines whether this material is tone mapped according to the renderer's [page:WebGLRenderer.toneMapping toneMapping] setting. Default is *true*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean transparent]</h3>
		<p>
		Defines whether this material is transparent. This has an effect on rendering
		as transparent objects need special treatment and are rendered after
		non-transparent objects. <br />
		When set to true, the extent to which the material is transparent is
		controlled by setting it's [page:Float opacity] property. <br />
		Default is *false*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:String type]</h3>
		<p>
		Value is the string 'Material'. This shouldn't be changed, and can be used to
		find all objects of this type in a scene.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:String uuid]</h3>
		<p>
		[link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier UUID] of this material instance.
		This gets automatically assigned, so this shouldn't be edited.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer vertexColors]</h3>
		<p>
		Defines whether vertex coloring is used.
		Default is [page:Materials THREE.NoColors].
		Other options are [page:Materials THREE.VertexColors] and [page:Materials THREE.FaceColors].
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean vertexTangents]</h3>
		<p>
		Defines whether precomputed vertex tangents, which must be provided in a vec4 "tangent" attribute,
		are used. When disabled, tangents are derived automatically. Using precomputed tangents will give
		more accurate normal map details in some cases, such as with mirrored UVs. Default is false.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean visible]</h3>
		<p>
		Defines whether this material is visible. Default is *true*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:object userData]</h3>
		<p>
		An object that can be used to store custom data about the Material. It should not hold
		references to functions as these will not be cloned.
		</p>

		<p>
