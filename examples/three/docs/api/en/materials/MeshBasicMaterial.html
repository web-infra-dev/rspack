		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			A material for drawing geometries in a simple shaded (flat or wireframe) way.<br /><br />

			This material is not affected by lights.
		</p>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>[name]( [param:Object parameters] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Object parameters] - (optional) an object with one or more properties defining the material's appearance.
			Any property of the material (including any property inherited from [page:Material]) can be passed in here.<br /><br />

			The exception is the property [page:Hexadecimal color], which can be passed in as a hexadecimal
			string and is *0xffffff* (white) by default. [page:Color.set]( color ) is called internally.
		</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>
		<p>See the base [page:Material] class for common properties.</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture alphaMap]</h3>
		<p>The alpha map is a grayscale texture that controls the opacity across the surface
			(black: fully transparent; white: fully opaque). Default is null.<br /><br />

			Only the color of the texture is used, ignoring the alpha channel if one exists.
			For RGB and RGBA textures, the [page:WebGLRenderer WebGL] renderer will use the
			green channel when sampling this texture due to the extra bit of precision provided
			for green in DXT-compressed and uncompressed RGB 565 formats. Luminance-only and
			luminance/alpha textures will also still work as expected.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture aoMap]</h3>
		<p>The red channel of this texture is used as the ambient occlusion map. Default is null.
		The aoMap requires a second set of UVs, and consequently will ignore the [page:Texture repeat]
		and [page:Texture offset] Texture properties.</p>

		<h3>[property:Float aoMapIntensity]</h3>
		<p>Intensity of the ambient occlusion effect. Default is 1. Zero is no occlusion effect.</p>

		<h3>[property:Color color]</h3>
		<p>[page:Color] of the material, by default set to white (0xffffff).</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer combine]</h3>
		<p>
			How to combine the result of the surface's color with the environment map, if any.<br /><br />

			Options are [page:Materials THREE.Multiply] (default), [page:Materials THREE.MixOperation],
			[page:Materials THREE.AddOperation]. If mix is chosen, the [page:.reflectivity] is used to
			blend between the two colors.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isMeshBasicMaterial]</h3>
		<p>
			Used to check whether this or derived classes are mesh basic materials. Default is *true*.<br /><br />

			You should not change this, as it used internally for optimisation.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:TextureCube envMap]</h3>
		<p>The environment map. Default is null.</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture lightMap]</h3>
		<p>The light map. Default is null. The lightMap requires a second set of UVs,
		and consequently will ignore the [page:Texture repeat] and [page:Texture offset]
		Texture properties.</p>

		<h3>[property:Float lightMapIntensity]</h3>
		<p>Intensity of the baked light. Default is 1.</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean lights]</h3>
		<p>Whether the material is affected by lights. Default is *false*.</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture map]</h3>
		<p>The color map. Default is  null.</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean morphTargets]</h3>
		<p>Define whether the material uses morphTargets. Default is false.</p>


		<h3>[property:Float reflectivity]</h3>
		<p>
			How much the environment map affects the surface; also see [page:.combine].
			The default value is 1 and the valid range is between 0 (no reflections) and 1 (full reflections).
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float refractionRatio]</h3>
		<p>
			The index of refraction (IOR) of air (approximately 1) divided by the index of refraction of the material.
			It is used with environment mapping modes [page:Textures THREE.CubeRefractionMapping] and [page:Textures THREE.EquirectangularRefractionMapping].
			The refraction ratio should not exceed 1. Default is *0.98*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean skinning]</h3>
		<p>Define whether the material uses skinning. Default is false.</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture specularMap]</h3>
		<p>Specular map used by the material. Default is null.</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean wireframe]</h3>
		<p>Render geometry as wireframe. Default is *false* (i.e. render as flat polygons).</p>

		<h3>[property:String wireframeLinecap]</h3>
		<p>
			Define appearance of line ends. Possible values are "butt", "round" and "square". Default is 'round'.<br /><br />

			This corresponds to the [link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineCap 2D Canvas lineCap]
			property and it is ignored by the [page:WebGLRenderer WebGL] renderer.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:String wireframeLinejoin]</h3>
		<p>
			Define appearance of line joints. Possible values are "round", "bevel" and "miter". Default is 'round'.<br /><br />

			This corresponds to the [link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineJoin 2D Canvas lineJoin]
			property and it is ignored by the [page:WebGLRenderer WebGL] renderer.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float wireframeLinewidth]</h3>
		<p>Controls wireframe thickness. Default is 1.<br /><br />

		Due to limitations of the [link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec46.core.pdf OpenGL Core Profile]
		with the [page:WebGLRenderer WebGL] renderer on most platforms linewidth will
		always be 1 regardless of the set value.
