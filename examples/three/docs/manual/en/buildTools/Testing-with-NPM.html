		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			This article shows how to get three.js into a [link:https://nodejs.org/en/ node.js] environment so that you
			can execute automated tests. Tests can be run on the command line, or by automated
			CI tools like [link:https://travis-ci.org/ Travis].
		</p>

		<h2>The short version</h2>

		<p>
			If you're comfortable with node and npm,
			<code>
				$ npm install three --save-dev
			</code>
			and add
		<code>
			var THREE = require('three');
		</code>
			to your test.
		</p>

		<h2>Create a testable project from scratch</h2>
		<p>
			If you're not familiar with these tools, here's a quick guide (for linux, the installation process
			will be slightly different using windows, but the NPM commands are identical).
		</p>

		<h3>Basic setup</h3>
		<div>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Install [link:https://www.npmjs.org/ npm] and nodejs. The shortest path typically looks something like
					<code>
$ sudo apt-get install -y npm nodejs-legacy
# fix any problems with SSL in the default registry URL
$ npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/
					</code>
				</li>

				<li>
					Make a new project directory
					<code>
						 $ mkdir test-example; cd test-example
					</code>
				</li>

				<li>
					Ask npm to create a new project file for you:
					<code>
					 $ npm init
					</code>
					 and accept all defaults by hitting Enter on all the prompts.
					 This will create package.json.
				</li><br />

				<li>
					Try and start the test feature with
					<code>
$ npm test
					</code>
					This will fail, which is expected.
					If you look in the package.json, the definition of the test script is
					<code>
						"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
					</code>
				</li>

			</ol>
		</div>

		<h2>Add mocha</h2>
		<div>
			We're going to use [link:https://mochajs.org/ mocha].

			<ol>
				<li>
					Install mocha with
					<code>
$ npm install mocha --save-dev
					</code>
					Notice that node_modules/ is created and your dependencies appear in there.
				  Also notice that your package.json has been updated: the property devDependencies
					is added and updated by the use of --save-dev.
				</li><br />

				<li>
					Edit package.json to use mocha for testing. When test is invoked, we just want to run
					mocha and specify a verbose reporter. By default this will run anything in test/
					(not having directory test/ can run into npm ERR!, create it by mkdir test)
					<code>
						"test": "mocha --reporter list"
					</code>
				</li>

				<li>
					Rerun the test with
					<code>
						$ npm test
					</code>

					This should now succeed, reporting 0 passing (1ms)
				 	or similar.
				</li>

			</ol>
		</div>

		<h2>Add three.js</h2>
		<div>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Let's pull in our three.js dependency with
					<code>
$ npm install three --save-dev
					</code>
					<ul>
						<li>
							If you need a different three version, use
							<code>
								$ npm show three versions
							</code>
						  to see
							what's available. To tell npm the right one, use
							<code>
 $ npm install three@0.84.0 --save
							</code>
							(0.84.0 in this example). --save makes this a dependency of this project, rather than
							dev dependency. See the docs [link:https://www.npmjs.org/doc/json.html here] for more info.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					Mocha will look for tests in test/, so let's
					<code>
					$ mkdir test
					</code>
				</li>

				<li>
					Finally we actually need a JS test to run. Let's add a simple test that will verify that
					the three.js object is available and working. Create test/verify-three.js containing:
<code>
var THREE = require('three');
var assert = require("assert");

describe('The THREE object', function() {
  it('should have a defined BasicShadowMap constant', function() {
    assert.notEqual('undefined', THREE.BasicShadowMap);
  }),

  it('should be able to construct a Vector3 with default of x=0', function() {
    var vec3 = new THREE.Vector3();
    assert.equal(0, vec3.x);
  })
})
</code>
				</li>

				<li>
				Finally let's test again with $ npm test. This should run the tests above and succeed,
				showing something like:
				<code>
The THREE object should have a defined BasicShadowMap constant: 0ms
The THREE object should be able to construct a Vector3 with default of x=0: 0ms
2 passing (8ms)
				</code>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<h2>Add your own code</h2>
		<div>
			You need to do three things:

			<ol>
				<li>
					Write a test for the expected behaviour of your code, and place it under test/.
					[link:https://github.com/air/encounter/blob/master/test/Physics-test.js Here] is an example from a real project.
				</li>

				<li>
					Export your functional code in such a way that nodejs can see it, for use in conjunction with require.
					See it [link:https://github.com/air/encounter/blob/master/js/Physics.js here].
				</li>

				<li>
					Require your code into the test file, in the same way we did a require('three') in the example above.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				Items 2 and 3 will vary depending on how you manage your code. In the example of Physics.js
		  	given above, the export part is right at the end. We assign an object to module.exports:
			</p>
			<code>
//=============================================================================
// make available in nodejs
//=============================================================================
if (typeof exports !== 'undefined')
{
  module.exports = Physics;
}
			</code>
		</div>

		<h2>Dealing with dependencies</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				If you're already using something clever like require.js or browserify, skip this part.
			</p>
			<p>
				Typically a three.js project is going to run in the browser. Module loading is hence done by
				the browser executing a bunch of script tags. Your individual files don't have to worry
				about dependencies. In a nodejs context however, there is no index.html binding everything
				together, so you have to be explicit.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're exporting a module that depends on other files, you're going to have to tell node to load them.
				Here is one approach:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					At the start of your module, check to see if you're in a nodejs environment.
				</li>
				<li>
					If so, explicitly declare your dependencies.
				</li>
				<li>
					If not, you're probably in a browser so you don't need to do anything else.
				</li>
			</ol>
			Example code from Physics.js:
			<code>
//=============================================================================
// setup for server-side testing
//=============================================================================
if (typeof require === 'function') // test for nodejs environment
{
  var THREE = require('three');
  var MY3 = require('./MY3.js');
}
			</code>
		</div>
