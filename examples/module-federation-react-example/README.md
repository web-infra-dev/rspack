# Module Federation React Example

A comprehensive React application demonstrating Module Federation with shared UI components, state management, and optimized bundle sharing.

## 🚀 Features

- **React 18** with concurrent features
- **Module Federation** for micro-frontend architecture
- **Ant Design** UI library shared between apps
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Chart.js** for data visualization
- **Optimized bundles** with tree-shaking

```

## 🛠️ Setup & Development

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd examples/module-federation-react-example
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start development servers:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   This starts both host (port 3001) and remote (port 3002) applications concurrently.

## 🚀 Build & Optimization Pipeline

For production builds, follow this complete pipeline:

### Step 1: Build Applications
```bash
pnpm build
```
This builds both host and remote applications using Rspack, generating:
- `host/dist/` - Main application bundle
- `remote/dist/` - Remote components bundle
- `share-usage.json` files for optimization analysis

### Step 2: Optimize Shared Chunks (Tree-Shaking)
```bash
pnpm optimize
```
This runs the advanced tree-shaking optimization that:
- Analyzes shared module usage across applications
- Removes unused exports from shared libraries
- Reduces bundle sizes by 30-70%
- Generates optimization reports

### Step 3: Serve Production Build
```bash
# Start host application
pnpm -C host serve

# Start remote application (in another terminal)
pnpm -C remote serve
```

### Complete Production Pipeline
```bash
# One-command production build with optimization
pnpm build && pnpm optimize
```

## 🎯 What's Demonstrated

### Host Application
- Full dashboard with multiple pages
- Consumes remote components dynamically
- Shared state management across federated modules
- Responsive layout with Ant Design

### Remote Application
- Exports reusable React components:
  - `UserCard` - User profile display
  - `DataTable` - Advanced data grid
  - `ChartWidget` - Various chart types
  - `FormBuilder` - Dynamic form generation
- Components work standalone or integrated

### Shared Dependencies
- `react` & `react-dom` - Singleton shared
- `antd` - UI component library
- `@reduxjs/toolkit` & `react-redux` - State management
- `react-router-dom` - Routing
- `lodash-es` - Utility functions
- `chart.js` & `react-chartjs-2` - Charts

## 🔧 Key Configuration

### Module Federation Setup

**Remote exposes:**
```javascript
exposes: {
  "./UserCard": "./src/components/UserCard",
  "./DataTable": "./src/components/DataTable",
  "./ChartWidget": "./src/charts/ChartWidget",
  "./FormBuilder": "./src/forms/FormBuilder",
  "./store": "./src/store/slices"
}
```

**Host consumes:**
```javascript
remotes: {
  remote: "remote@http://localhost:3002/remoteEntry.js"
}
```

## 🔧 Advanced Optimization Features

The optimization script (`scripts/optimize-shared-chunks.js`) provides:

- **Real-time Usage Analysis**: Scans `share-usage.json` files to identify unused exports
- **SWC WASM Integration**: Uses high-performance WASM-based tree-shaking
- **Cross-Application Analysis**: Optimizes shared modules across host and remote apps
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generate optimization reports with `pnpm optimize --report`

### Optimization Results
- **Before**: ~2MB initial bundle size
- **After**: ~600KB optimized bundle size
- **Savings**: 30-70% reduction in shared module sizes
- **Performance**: Faster load times with reduced network overhead

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**`isPlainObject is not a function` Error**
This runtime error occurs due to aggressive tree-shaking of transitive dependencies. See detailed analysis in `docs/module-federation-redux-isplainobject-analysis.md`.

**Solution**: The optimization process handles this automatically, but if you encounter issues:
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
pnpm clean
pnpm build && pnpm optimize
```

**Build Failures**
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pnpm install`
- Check that both applications build individually: `pnpm -C host build && pnpm -C remote build`
- Verify WASM optimizer is available: `ls scripts/optimize-shared-chunks.js`

**Port Conflicts**
- Host runs on port 3001, Remote on port 3002
- Change ports in `rspack.config.js` if needed

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run specific test suites
pnpm test:unit
pnpm test:integration
pnpm test:e2e
```
