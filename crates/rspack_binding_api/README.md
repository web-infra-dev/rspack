## API Usage Warning

üö® **This package's API should NOT be used as a public Rust API**

This crate is designed to be linked as a **C dynamic library** during Rspack binding generation, not as a public Rust API for external consumption.

### For Developers

If you're working on Rspack itself:
- This crate is safe to use within the Rspack project
- Changes should be coordinated with the binding generation process
- Test thoroughly when making changes

If you're an external developer:
- Do not depend on this crate directly
- Use the official Rspack Node.js package instead
- Report issues through the main Rspack repository

If you're a user of Rspack custom binding:
- Do not depend on this crate directly
- Use [`rspack_binding_builder`](https://crates.io/crates/rspack_binding_builder) to build your own binding
