# Collaborators

Rspack collaborators maintain the Rspack Project on GitHub.

Collaborators have:

- Commit access to the Rspack repository
- Access to the Rspack continuous integration (CI) jobs

Both collaborators and non-collaborators may propose changes to the Rspack source code.
The mechanism to propose such a change is a GitHub pull request.
Collaborators review and merge (land) pull requests.

One collaborator from the assigned reviewers must approve a pull request before the pull request can land.
Approving a pull request indicates that the collaborator accepts responsibility for the change.
Approval must be from collaborators who are not authors of the change.

If a collaborator opposes a proposed change, then the change cannot land. The proposed pull request will first be assigned the "to be discussed" label.
The Rspack Core Team will hold an discussion and make the final decision on the change.
The Rspack Core Team may contact the collaborator on a different communication channel.
Please note this is a rare circumstance.

Current list of collaborators (in alphabetical order):

- [@web-infra-dev/rspack-core]
- [@9aoy]
- [@bvanjoi]
- [@chenjiahan]
- [@JSerFeng]
- [@sanyuan0704]
- [@suxin2017]
- [@valorkin]
- [@zackarychapple]

Collaborator activities
- Triage issues
- Helping users and novice contributors
- Contributing code and documentation changes that improve the project

## Collaborator Privileges

- Entry on the team page on rspack.dev

## Collaborator nominations

A Rspack collaborator can nominate someone to become a collaborator.
The Rspack Core Team decides on whom to become a collaborator based on their contributions.

## Consensus seeking process

Proposals and ideas can be submitted for agreement via a GitHub issue, PR, or GitHub Discussion.

For all Webpack-related technical issues, the consensus needs to be based on the Webpack project.
In situations where Rspack wants to deviate from Webpack,
Rspack Collaborators need to consult with the Webpack project.

For all other consensuses, the Rspack Core Team discusses with collaborators first and then makes the final decision.
This rule may be subject to change.
