## Credits

Thanks to:

- [The webpack team and community](https://webpack.js.org/) for creating a great bundler and ecosystem from which we draw a lot of inspiration.
- [@sokra](https://github.com/sokra) for the great work on the [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) project.
- [@ScriptedAlchemy](https://github.com/ScriptedAlchemy) for creating Module Federation and helping Rspack connect with the community.
- The [SWC](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) project created by [@kdy1](https://github.com/kdy1), which powers Rspack's code compilation and minification.
- The [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) project created by [@evanw](https://github.com/evanw), which inspired the concurrent architecture of Rspack.
- The [NAPI-RS](https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs) project created by [@Brooooooklyn](https://github.com/Brooooooklyn), which powers Rspack's node-binding implementation.
- The [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) project created by [@devongovett](https://github.com/devongovett) which inspired Rspack's incremental rebuild design.
- The [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) project created by [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803) which inspired Rspack's compatibility design of webpack's ecosystem.
- The [Rolldown](https://github.com/rolldown-rs/rolldown) project created by [Rolldown team](https://github.com/sponsors/rolldown-rs), which explores the possibility of making a performant bundler in Rust with Rollup-compatible API. It inspires the design principles of Rspack.
- The [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) project created by [@jantimon](https://github.com/jantimon), which inspired `@rspack/html-plugin`.
