## ‚ú® Features

- üöÄ **Fast Startup**: Based on Rust, the build speed is extremely fast, bringing you the ultimate development experience.
- ‚ö° **Lightning HMR**: With a built-in incremental compilation mechanism, HMR is extremely fast and fully capable of developing large-scale projects.
- üì¶ **Webpack Interoperable**: Compatible with the architecture and ecosystem of webpack, no need to build the ecosystem from scratch.
- üé® **Batteries Included**: Out-of-the-box support for TypeScript, JSX, CSS, CSS Modules, Sass, and more.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Production Optimization**: Various optimization strategies are built in by default, such as tree shaking, minification, etc.
- üéØ **Framework Agnostic**: Not bound to any frontend framework, ensuring enough flexibility.

## Credits

Thanks to:

- [The webpack team and community](https://webpack.js.org/) for creating a great bundler and ecosystem from which we draw a lot of inspiration.
- [@sokra](https://github.com/sokra) for the great work on the [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) project.
- [@ScriptedAlchemy](https://github.com/ScriptedAlchemy) for creating Module Federation and helping Rspack connect with the community.
- The [SWC](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) project created by [@kdy1](https://github.com/kdy1), which powers Rspack's code parsing, transformation and minification.
- The [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) project created by [@evanw](https://github.com/evanw), which inspired the concurrent architecture of Rspack.
- The [NAPI-RS](https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs) project created by [@Brooooooklyn](https://github.com/Brooooooklyn), which powers Rspack's node-binding implementation.
- The [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) project created by [@devongovett](https://github.com/devongovett) which is the pioneer of rust bundler and inspired Rspack's incremental rebuild design.
- The [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) project created by [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803) which inspired Rspack's compatibility design of webpack's ecosystem.
- The [rolldown-legacy](https://github.com/rolldown-rs/rolldown-legacy) project created by old [Rolldown team](https://github.com/rolldown-rs), It's the predecessor of the [rolldown](https://github.com/rolldown) project, which explores the possibility of making a performant bundler in Rust with Rollup-compatible API. It inspires the design principles of Rspack.
- The [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) project created by [@jantimon](https://github.com/jantimon), `@rspack/html-plugin` is a fork of [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) to avoid some webpack API usage not supported in Rspack.
- The [Turbopack](https://github.com/vercel/turbo) project which inspired the AST path logic of Rspack.
- The [react-refresh-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin) created by [@pmmmwh](https://github.com/pmmmwh), which inspires implement react refresh.
