# Rspack JavaScript API benchmarks

The primary objective of this project is to track the performance of the Rspack JavaScript API and prevent performance degradation.

## Notes for writing benchmark cases

CPU instrument is better suited for micro-benchmarks (taking less than a second) focused on CPU-bound tasks, not system calls.

System calls introduce variability in execution time. This variability is influenced by several factors, including system load, network latency, and disk I/O performance. As a result, the execution time of system calls can fluctuate significantly, making them the most inconsistent part of a program's execution time.
